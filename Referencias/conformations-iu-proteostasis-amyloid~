Durante la última década, uno de los mayores cambios en el campo
de las proteínas ha sido el reconocimiento de la ubicuidad e importancia de las proteínas
intrínsecamente desordenadas. Un reflejo de estas investigaciones puede encontrarse en bases de
datos específicas (18) y aplicaciones bioinformáticas capaces de identificar el desorden intrínseco (19).
Dichas secuencias presentan en solución un conjunto heterogéneo de conformaciones fácilmente
maleable por cambios en el medio. En lugar del análisis estructural clásico basado en dominios
globulares, podemos describir estos conjuntos conformacionales en términos de los promedios y
desviaciones estándar de la distancia entre los extremos de la secuencia, el radio hidrodinámico, el
contenido en estructura secundaria y otros parámetros (20).


En los ultimos años se han encontrado gran cantidad de proteinas que adoptan cuyas estructuras son total o parcialmente desordenadas(segmentos globulares). 
El estudio de estas proteinas llevo a encontrar una gran cantidad de funcionalidades asociadas, .... 
The physical characteristics of IDPs allow an exqui‐
site level of control of cellular signalling processes. Their
favourable characteristics include: the presence of small
recognition elements that fold on partner binding; a
degree of flexibility, which enables them to interact
promiscuously with different targets on different occa‐
sions; accessible sites for post-translational modificatio­n;
e­fficient utilization of conserved sequence motifs to
mediate binding interactions; the ability to bind part‐
ners with high specificity but modest affinity, leading to rapid and spontaneous dissociation and termination of
the signal 1,3,19 ; kinetic advantages in signalling 20 , as their
extremely fast association rates allow signals to be rap‐
idly turned on.


Al diseñar una secuencia con estas propiedades estructurales, y que queremos que sea a la vez inerte, se deberán chequear todas estas diversas funcionalidades de la mejor manera posible.

PROTEIN AGGREGATES
***********************
The state of a protein that is adopted under specific conditions
depends on the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the various
accessible conformations and on the kinetics of their interconversion


Proteins might aggregate into ordered(fibrillar amyloids) or amorphous aggregates structures, utilizing relatively short sequence stretches, 
usually organized in b-sheet-like assemblies. 
These differences in structure also reflect biological differences; amyloid and amorphous beta-sheet aggregates have different chaperone affinities,
accumulate in different cellular locations and are degraded by different mechanisms.

The amyloid conformation reflects an intrinsic conformational
propensity of polypeptides as many proteins can be forced into
amyloid fibrils by manipulating external conditions. However,
amyloid formation is also a sequence-specific process 14,15 .
Under physiological conditions, most peptide sequences derived
from proteins will remain soluble even at high concentrations,
whereas most hydrophobic sequences will invariably aggregate
as amorphous aggregates.
Despite active research, a detailed under-
standing of the molecular principles underlying the transformation
of soluble proteins into amyloid aggregates is still lacking

Several methods have been published recently that attempt to predict aggregation-prone or amyloidogenic regions based on various properties of proteins (TANGO, PASTA, WALTZ, SALSA, aggrescan, zyggregator).Some of these prediction methods try to distinguish amyloid fibril
(ordered aggregates) prediction from amorphous
aggregate prediction, providing also the relevant physi-
cal reasoning and influencing factors.

Owing to the relatively small amount
and diversity of experimentally validated amyloidogenic sequences,
sequence-based prediction algorithms do not possess sufficient
information to distinguish amyloid from amorphous aggregates.
They generally also have rather poor predictive capabilities toward
amyloid sequences from yeast prions and functional amyloids. In
contrast, structure-based homology modeling methods 25,40 can in
principle provide very specific predictions. However, as side-chain
modeling is very sensitive to even modest changes in backbone
conformation, structure-based approaches are also limited by a
shortage of experimentally determined structures 28


Es importante analizar un poco este tema de los diferentes factores que influyen en adoptar distintas formas de agregacion.
De todas formas, en nuestro trabajo se intenta eliminar toda posibilidad de agregado de proteinas.



Most proteins form amorphous aggregates that
are characterized by a lack of regular three-dimensional structure.
Under physiologically relevant conditions, however, several pro-
teins aggregate into fibrillar amyloids (ver proximo parrafo, que habla de una propiedad inherente de las proteinas) .
As with all self-assembly processes, these differences in macromolecular structure reflect
differences in packing and molecular structure at the atomic level 7 .
These structural differences also reflect biological differences.
Whereas misfolded and aggregated proteins are found in peri-
nuclear locations and are generally degraded by the protea­somal
system 8,9 , amyloids preferentially accumulate in perivacuolar
inclusions, where they are degraded by the autophagosome.
This segregation directly results from a differential recognition by the
protein quality control system 10 . A reduced affinity of amyloids
for the protein quality control system is probably also at the root
of their higher toxicity 11 as artificial overexpression of chaperones
usually leads to decreased toxicity and removal of amyloids from
he cell 12 . Contrary to amorphous aggregates, amyloid structures
can fulfill biological functions, and functional amyloids are found
in organisms from prokaryotes to humans(ver paper functionalAmyloids).



From a wide range of in vitro experiments on
peptides and proteins we now know that the formation of
amyloid structures is not a rare phenomenon associated
with a small number of diseases but rather that it reflects a
well-defined structural form of the protein that is an alter-
native to the native state — a form that may in principle be
adopted by many, if not all, polypeptide sequences

Amyloidogenic proteins are quite diverse, with little similarity in
sequence and native three-dimensional structure [1,2].
Additionally, several proteins and peptides not related
to amyloidoses have the potential to form amyloid
fibrils in vitro, suggesting that this ability for structural 
rearrangement and aggregation may be inherent to
proteins.
An increasingly adopted view is that
the ability to form amyloid fibrils is a general property of the
polypeptide backbone (6). Nevertheless, the propensity of a given
polypeptide to form amyloid fibrils depends enormously on amino
acid composition.
Dicho de otra forma: Even though the ability to form amyloid fibrils seems to be generic,
the propensity to do so under given circumstances can vary markedly
between different sequences.

Amorphous β-sheet aggregation, however, is less position-
dependent and can, in principle, be achieved by any sequence that
can adopt an extended conformation, is sufficiently hydrophobic
and has no unsatisfied hydrogens or electostatic groups 18,19 . Thus
β-sheet aggregation can be relatively easily predicted by methods
that evaluate aggregation by evaluating biophysical parameters
over a sequence segment, without the need for considering
position-dependent values of these parameters.







The multiplicity of protein states:
In addition to their functional native structures, protein­s
also populate various other states, including disordered
and partially ordered conformations, and different
aggregate­d assemblies

Although it was evident from early studies that both soluble and fibril-
lar forms of proteins could exist 33 , most attention was
focused on the soluble states that were found to possess
demonstrable biological function.


A combination of experimental and
theoretical studies has clarified how given sequences
define specific free energy surfaces that enable folding 38–40 .
This problem is, however, challenging, as a free energy
surface depends on a very large number of relatively
weak interactions, including hydrogen bonds, electro­
static interactions, dispersion forces and interactions with
solvent molecules that underlie the hydrophobic effect.
Moreover, as we discuss below, in some cases the native
state of a given peptide or protein may not be structured
in a globular form but disordered. Regardless of its nature,
however, the functional native state is likely to only reflect
a local free energy minimum at physiological concentra-
tions, as self-association into aggregated protein spe-
cies may in many cases lower the global free energy 41,42
(BOX 1) . Indeed, the maintenance of protein solubility has
emerged as a central aspect of the more general topic of
protein homeostasis 3,43,44 .


***Esto esta en \cite{de2004sequence} ***
A protein has to be partially or fully unfolded to aggregate (1, 2).
Yet, mutations leading to aggregation can alter (9, 10), or not alter
(11, 12), protein stability. Aggregation from some peptides and
proteins involved in relevant amyloidoses, such as type II diabetes
and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, does not require, how-
ever, previous unfolding, because these molecules are largely
unstructured under physiological conditions (2). Nevertheless, most
of the natively unfolded proteins in vivo do not undergo aggregation
(13), indicating that unfolding is necessary, but not sufficient, to
promote aggregation.
Hence, there must be some sequence motifs
that, once they become exposed, are more prone to aggregation
than others. In fact, experimental evidence is compelling in favor of
the hypothesis that small regions of a protein are responsible for its
amyloidogenic behavior



Como se dice, intrinsically disordered proteins are not necessarily prone to aggregation, as
their sequences have usually evolved to maintain the level
of solubility that is required for their optimal function;
for example, through the existence of extensive regions
that are highly abundant in charged and polar groups
that disfavour intermolecular association from a thermo­
dynamic point of view. 
Moreover, as is discussed below,
kinetic barriers to aggregation are crucial in enabling both
globular and disordered proteins to maintain their soluble
and functional states


Many proteins adopt various other biologically rel-
evant conformational states in addition to their native
structure.  These
partially folded protein species are particularly vulner-
able to misfolding and aggregation from which they must
be protected in living systems


Although most common forms of proteins are
soluble, some functional states are insoluble,
for example the fibrillar assemblies that form the cellular
cytoskeleton. Proteins are also, however,
vulnerable to forming a wide variety of non-functional
aggregated species. Indeed, proteins exhibit generic poly­
meric and colloidal patterns of behaviour.
Aggregated forms of proteins can be generally amorphous on an ultra­structural
level. Of particular fascination, however, because of their
remarkable structures and properties, are highly ordered
self-associated species of peptides and proteins, notably
amyloid fibrils and closely related prion-like states.

it has been found that the proteinaceous
deposits extracted from tissues in misfolding diseases
typically have amyloid characteristics.
Remarkably, there is no evident similarity in
the sequences, native structures or functions of the group
of disease-associated proteins.


Normally soluble proteins or peptides convert under
certain conditions into ordered fibrillar aggregates
known as amyloid deposits.

Several observations (por ejemplo que ordinary peptides and proteins can convert
under appropriate laboratory conditions into aggregates with all the characteristics of the amyloid fibrils),
, together with a wide variety of biophysical and computational
studies, led to the suggestion that the amyloid structure
can in principle be adopted by any polypeptide chain.


******* The amyloid state of a protein is therefore generic,
as it is accessible to many different polypeptide chains,
and, unlike the native state, its essential architecture is
not encoded by the amino acid sequence 1,26 , although
the details of its structure and stability can be markedly
sequence-dependent, as we discuss below. ********************


Similar to globular
native states, amyloid structures are closely packed and
highly ordered






****************************************
The healthy state of a cell is characterized by a detailed
balance between the different states that proteins can
populate. Perturbations to such balance, unless they are
kept under strict control, can lead to deleterious events
and disease.
****************************************
It is accepted that misfolding of peptides and proteins cause the
fibrillar aggregates that characterize the group of diseases known
as amyloidoses







FUNCTIONAL AMYLOIDS:
Amyloids are not only associated with disease-related proteins.
Nature also exploits the structural and mechanical properties
of amyloids to regulate biological functions 13 . For example, in
bacteria amyloids such as curli promote biofilm formation and
host invasion, and chaplins in bacteria and hydrophobins in yeast
act as regulators of surface tension of water. Insects and fish
use chorion amyloid as a component of eggshell, and spiders
use spidroins in spider silk. Humans possess at least one func-
tional amyloid protein: Pmel17 is used as a structural scaffold
in melanin synthesis. The strength and flexibility of amyloids
have attracted attention for their use as biomaterials. However,
it remains to be understood how functional amyloids avoid the
cytotoxic effects observed in disease amyloids. In part, functional
amyloids are regulated by chaperones and proteases. But it is
also becoming evident that sequence composition modulates
critical biophysical parameters determining kinetics of assembly
or mechanical strength.

PAPER: Understanding Protein Non-Folding
***********************************
***********************************


From the 1980s onwards, a number of researchers pointed out that lack of structure or flexibility
can be important for biological function.

some of the ID proteins have been discovered due their unusual amino acid sequence compositions and the absence of
regular structure in these proteins has been explained by the specific features of their amino
acid sequences including the presence of numerous uncompensated charged groups (often
negative); i.e., a high net charge at neutral pH, arising from the extreme pI values in such
proteins , and a low content of hydrophobic amino acid residues.
it has been concluded that the combination of low mean hydrophobicity and
relatively high net charge represents an important prerequisite for the absence of compact
structure in proteins under physiological conditions. 
This observation was used to develop a charge-hydropathy (CH) plot method of analysis
that distinguishes ordered and disordered proteins based only on their net charges and
hydropathies.
rom the physical viewpoint, such a combination of low hydrophobicity with high net charge
as a prerequisite for intrinsic unfoldedness makes perfect sense: high net charge leads to charge-
charge repulsion, and low hydrophobicity means less driving force for protein compaction. In
other words, these features are characteristic for ID proteins with the coil-like (or close to coil-
like) structures.
the disordered proteins are significantly depleted in bulky
hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, and Val) and aromatic amino acid residues (Trp, Tyr, and Phe), which
would normally form the hydrophobic core of a folded globular protein, and also possess low
content of Cys and Asn residues.
The depletion of ID protein in Cys is also crucial as this amino
acid residue is known to have a significant contribution to the protein conformation stability
via the disulfide bond formation or being involved in coordination of different prosthetic
groups.
On the other hand, ID proteins were shown to be substantially
enriched in polar, disorder-promoting, amino acids: Ala, Arg, Gly, Gln, Ser, Glu, and Lys and
also in the hydrophobic, but structure braking Pro.

In addition to amino-acid composition, the disordered segments have also been compared with
the ordered ones by various attributes such as hydropathy, net charge, flexibility index, helix
propensities, strand propensities, and compositions for groups of amino acids such as W + Y
+ F (aromaticity).

Thus, the ID proteins differ dramatically from the ordered proteins in their amino acid
sequences. These differences were used to develop different predictors of intrinsic disorder.

ID proteins have dynamic structures that interconvert on a number of timescales and have been
shown to have many similarities to non-native states of “normal” globular proteins, which may
exist in at least four different conformations: native (ordered), molten globule, pre-molten
globule, and coil-like.
Using this analogy, it has been established that ID proteins
and regions under physiological conditions in vitro might contain collapsed-disorder (i.e.,
where ID is present in a form of molten globules) and extended-disorder (i.e., regions where
ID is present in a form of random coil or pre-molten globule)


****Collapsed disorder********  The structural properties of the molten globule (which was
originally described as universal folding intermediate of globular proteins) are well known and
have been systematized in number of reviews (e.g., see [38] and references therein). The protein
molecule in this intermediate state has no (or has only a trace of) rigid cooperatively melted
tertiary structure. However, it is characterized not only by the well-developed secondary
structure, but also by the presence of some topology, i.e., relatively fixed mutual positioning
of the secondary structure elements [124-131]. A considerable increase in the accessibility of
a protein molecule to proteases was noted as a specific property of the molten globule
[132-136]. The transformation into this intermediate state is accompanied by a considerable
increase in the affinity of a protein molecule to the hydrophobic fluorescence probes


****** Extended disorder***  A significant number of sequences encodes for the extendedly
disordered proteins that are characterized by low sequence complexity. Are these proteins
random coils, or do they possess residual or transient structure? If they have residual or transient
structure, how should they be classified? Based on the analysis of the available literature, it
has been concluded that such proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected
for members of a single thermodynamic entity. In fact, they may be divided into two structurally
different groups, intrinsic coils and intrinsic pre-molten globules

The unfolded protein is essentially never a true random coil. In fact, the existence of significant
residual structure in the unfolded globular protein has been described even under the most
severe denaturing conditions, such as high concentrations of strong denaturants [144-147].
Thus, coil-like ID proteins are not completely random, but are characterized by the presence
of some residual (and highly flexible) structure. This fact is very important for the functioning
of these proteins.


INDUCED FIT:
Induced fit interactions can also occur between structural domains and relatively large natively unstructured regions of other proteins. 
The natively unstructured region is then induced to form a stable structure, but only in the presence of the interacting structural domain.






LINEAR MOTIFS:





RELACION ENTRE IUPs AND LINEAR MOTIFs:

***** GRAN PARTe ESTA SACADO DEL paper \cite{fuxreiter2007local}  Se analiza the relationship  between LMs and molecular recognition elements in IUPs.**********
******LA HIPOTESIS INICIAL ES QUE EL MECANISMO SUBYACENTE DE FUNCIONAMIENTO DE LOS LMs ES EXACTAMENTE EL MISMO QUE EL QUE FUE ASIGNADO A LOS ELEMENTOS(MoREs???) de las IUPs.
PARA PROBAR ESTA HIPOTESIS, ENTONCES AGARRAN LOS ELMs CONOCIDOS Y EVALUAN SUS PROPIEDADES DE ESTRUCTURA Y COMPOSICION PRINCIPALMENTE, LLEGANDO A LA CONCLUSION QUE ESTAS PROPIEDADES SE INTERSECTAN/CONCUERDAN COMPLETAMENTE CON LAS DE LOS SEGMENTOS DE RECONOCIMIENTO EN LAS IUPs, QUIERE DECIR QUE SON LO MISMO???????? *************

INTRODUCCION:
LMs represent a functionally very heterogeneous group, with proteins involved in either distinct post-translational modification reactions, or transient/permanent binding of other cellular constituents.
Dynamics of the cell is ensured by the information flow across precisely regulated protein–protein interaction networks. This process requires efficient communication between the partici pating proteins realized via their interactions. In classical terms, this is achieved via a tight, high-affinity fit of protein domains that possess stable three-dimensional structures. Evolution of such globular domains, however, is slower than that of short sequential motifs of a linear arrangement of specificity determinants. These latter, due to relying on a very few confined residues and limited structural constraints, may frequently arise and disappear by point mutations, and confer extreme adaptability to the interactome.
The resulting low affinity complexes are characterized by fast on and off binding rates that may serve regulatory purposes. Our interest was grasped by the fact that these very same features and functional advantages are repeatedly ascribed to IUPs, proteins or protein domains that function without a stable structure. Key advantages of LMs reside in that they facilitate the communication between proteins by having less stringent requirements for association. The resulting lowaffinity complexes are characterized by fast on and off binding rates that may serve regulatory purposes.
The overlap, or possible mutual correspondence, of LMs and short recognition elements in IUPs is of significant appeal. ((( los short recog. elements son los elementos funcionales de las IUPs????????))) 
The recent recognition that alternative splicing preferentially occurs in locally disordered regions of proteins, and removes short recognition elements (Romero et al., 2006) extends the range of this possible correspondence. These examples raised the question if the molecular action of all LMs is based on the same principle of short recognition elements in unstructured regions.
 *****LA HIPOTESIS ES QUE SON LO MISMO......... AL MENOS EN ALGUNOS CASOS, O PARA ALGUNAS FUNCIONALIDADES !!! !!!!!!!!!!! ******


ESTUDIO DE DESORDEN:
Linear motif-domain interactions are a subset of induced fit interactions, where the templated structure is induced in a short peptide of only a few residues. As a
consequence of the small number of residues involved, such interactions tend to be transient and have low binding affinities.
Therefore, they are well suited for mediating functions that require a fast response to changing stimuli. 
A classical example is the dynamic interaction between a kinase and its phosphorylation site: the kinase domain needs to bind to the peptide, attach the phosphate, and then dissociate again, potentially to then go on to interact in a similar way with other substrates.

The rationale of the connection between LMs(linear motifs) and intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins(IUPs/IDPs), is that the latters are frequently associated with
regulatory functions in signal transduction or transcription in eukaryotic proteomes. These functions are carried out by molecular recognition that is linked to a binding-coupled
folding process
Para realizar este analisis,se predice el desorden de LMs and their flanking regions en todos los ejemplos de LMs que fueron caracaterizados experimentalmente y estan en la base de datos
de Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM).
El analisis de desorden se hacen utilizando 2 herramientas seleccionadas de entre todas las herramientas existentes. Las herramientas de analisis utilizadas fueron IUPred y PONDR VSL1.
En todos los casos se obtiene que, tanto los LMs como las regiones flanquentes son preferentemente desestructuradas: the two predictors provide the consensus result that
the average score for LMs and their approximately 20 residue long flanking segments on both sides is above 0.5, i.e. these regions can be considered as intrinsically disordered
Un detalle es que IUPred predice un pico ´hacia abajo´ en el punto central del LM(indicando una region mas estructurada que su contexto). 
Tal irregularity in the disorder pattern was suggested to indicate a transient structural element that can facilitate binding.

Within LMs, however, the uniformity breaks down as the IUP-like attributes mostly apply to the variable residues
(non-restricted sites, NRSs), whereas specificity-determinant
conserved (consensus) residues (restricted sites, RSs) take on
the character of ordered, globular proteins. In general, LMs
appear to have been constructed by grafting residues prone to
be involved in protein-protein interactions onto a principally
unstructured carrier sequence. Whereas this design of embed-
ding appears to hold for the majority of LMs studied here, we
must not overlook that there are exceptions mostly occuring in
proteins associated with non-regulatory functions, where both
the LM and the neighboring environment can adopt a well-
defined fold.



ESTUDIO DE LA COMPOSICION DE LMs
The composition of LMs, as well as their 20-residue flanking segments shows significant deviations from the composition of globular proteins. 
Flanking regions are fairly similar to IUPs: they are enriched in flexible (disorder-promoting) amino acids, whereas depleted in hydrophobic and rigid (order-promoting) residues. 
On the other hand, they have considerably less charged residues than unstructured proteins, while they exhibit a larger excess of a small, polar residue, serine. 

LMs themselves have a unique amino acid composition, dissimilar to either globular or unstructured proteins, being abundant in both floppy and rigid residues, while depleted in amino acids of
medium flexibility. LMs are enriched in hydrophobic residues W, L, F and Y as well as in charged residues R, and D, likely to play distinguished role in partner recognition. 
They are conspicuously depleted in G and A, possibly to simultaneously curb flexibility (G) and the overt tendency to form secondary structural elements (A), while preserving an open but structurally somewhat constrained state. The prevalence of proline in both LMs and their flanking segments underscores this logic due to its preference for an extended secondary structure motif, the polyproline-II helix.

The sequence of LMs can be dissected, as typical motifs are defined by a short sequence pattern , in which certain residues are of restricted identity (usualmente serve as specificity
determinants of the LM), whereas others are of unrestricted identity (likely act as spacers).
As anticipated, the compositions of these sites are markedly different, which is responsible for the aforementioned peculiarity of LM propensities.

Overall, the amino acid composition reveals the mixed nature of LMs and their embedding environments as extended disordered regions (flanking + NRSs), onto which a few specificity-determinant
residues (RSs) have been grafted.

One of the characteristic features that distinguish IUPs from globular proteins is their high mean net charge and low mean hydrophobicity.
Una propiedad interesante es que, dentro de los LMs, a level of net charge both in RS and NRS positions exceeding even that of IUPs can be observed.

These charge/hydrophathy ratios unveil the functional relevance of the unique amino acid composition of LMs: the high propensity of both hydrophobicity and charge at RS positions
reflects their distinguished role as contacting residues in recognition, with interspersed variable positions selected more for flexibility/malleability. This pattern may also reveal an evolutionary compensatory mechanism, in which increased hydrophobicity brought about by residues involved in critical interactions(al aprecer, para cumplir ciertas funciones de interaccion son necesarios ciertos residuos que tambien favorecen el orden, cosa que no es favorable ya que estos motivos tienden al desorden) has been compensated by an increased net charge of LM, preserving a significant tendency of disorder despite the presence of residues, which strongly favor order.
En general, specificity determinant positions are abundant in hydrophobic and charged residues, and in many respects resemble globular proteins, whereas variable residues approximate features of IUPs. As a consequence, a local drop in plasticity is observed in the disorder profile computed by the IUPred method.


RESULTADOS - CONCLUSIONES - DISCUSION:
Our results suggest that LMs and molecular recognition
elements of IUPs significantly overlap, and in the majority of
cases represent an equivalent set of motifs in modular proteins.
The two definitions correspond to each other such as for
phosphorylation sites or calmodulin-binding regions, and is
expected to be so for more regulatory sites. In the case of
association of metabolic proteins however, they likely conform
to different concepts.

Basandose en el patron estructural encontrado (the LM with its flanking region is a locally unstructured segment of the protein, onto which a couple of conserved, mostly hydrophobic, specificity-determinant residues are grafted.) se propone que los LM, junto con las secuencias flanqueantes forman una unidad funcional 
structural pattern, we propose
that LMs together with their flanking segments form a larger
functional unit that can be considered as a super-secondary
structural element. Such elements classically correspond to structural/functional units within globular proteins, exemplified by the helix-turn-helix motif in DNA recognition 
or the alfa-beta-alfa fold in nucleotide coenzyme binding. These elements are defined by a conserved spatial arrangement of secondary structural elements, maintained by a characteristic amino acid composition. 
The super-secondary element encompassing LMs, as defined here, conforms to this definition, as it consists of a functional unit composed of three structurally defined parts: a
short, locally structured segment sandwiched between two disordered regions. The properties of the unstructured stretches are determined solely by their amino acid composition(ver estudios sobre la composicion en los parrafos anteriores), while the actual primary sequence is critical only for the central part. This is not only an evolutionary economical solution to modulate protein-protein interactions, but also provides various benefits in the recognition process itself.

The ensuing binding mode, where determinant residues serve as contact sites, while variable residues within the LM as well as in its flanking environment ensures their proper orientation, has
been often implicated in the interactions of IUPs with their partners, in the form of short recognition elements, described in various contexts as preformed structural elements, primary contact sites or molecular recognition elements (ACA YA HAY UN PARECIDO EN EL MECANISMO).
Besides a proper control on the thermodynamics of binding, this binding mode also enables an increased speed of recognition, also formulated in mechanistic models such as protein fishing or fly-casting. 
These considerations argue that the molecular action of LMs is intertwined(entrelazada) with the structural malleability of their embedding environment. Flanking segments enable the effective recognition of the target site that results in low-affinity contacts, which are of high specificity but readily reversible. Such modes of interactions are of significant benefit in regulation, signaling and network organization functions,

According to this scenario, the molecular mode of action of LMs and recognition elements of IUPs overlap, and probably reflect a similar phenomenon viewed from different angles thus far.

Whereas LMs have been identified as short sequence motifs critical in recognition functions, primary contact sites, preformed structural elements and molecular recognition elments/features have been approached from the direction of protein disorder, emphasizing recognition segments embedded in such regions. Unity of these concepts is underlined by the key role of a few specificity determinants in all these recognition elements, and also by their local preferences for undergoing disorder-to-order transition upon molecular recognition, which might already
be manifested prior to binding. 
Apart from a minority of the cases when LMs are constituted of segments of ordered domains, these different concepts of short recognition elements express the same underlying physical and
functional principles that provide a probably widespread solution to the dynamic control of protein-protein interaction networks.

WALTZ: waltz combines sequence, physicochemical as well as structural information into a composite scoring function.
web-based tool that uses, mainly, a posi-
tion-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) to determine amy-
loid-forming sequences [39]. The PSSM was built
based on the experimental exploration of the sequence
space of amyloid hexapeptides. According to its
authors, waltz allows for identification and better dis-
tinction between amyloid sequences and amorphous
b-sheet aggregates, and also allows for identification of
amyloid-forming regions in functional amyloids. In
more detail, the waltz algorithm was developed by
combining specific sequence information with physico-
chemical as well as structural information.
The PSSM for amyloid propensity of waltz, was
constructed from an experimentally defined training set
comprising 116 ‘positive’ (amyloid-forming) hexapeptides and 162 ‘negative’ (non-forming) hexapeptides
(http://waltz.switchlab.org/).
The position-specific score for
an amino acid was calculated as a standard log-odd
score in a position-specific scoring matrix (the value
for each amino acid at each position is the logarithm
of the ratio of its frequency in the training set and the
background database).

As the analysis of the hexapeptide experimental data
sets (positive and negative) may impose sequence bias
specific to the available data, the authors of waltz
estimated the preference or non-preference of amino
acids at the hexapeptide motif positions on a structural
basis using the atomic force field foldx. The fibril
crystal structure of the GNNQQNY peptide from
Sup35 (PDB 1YJP) was first simplified to polyalanine.
Then, all possible pair combinations of all 20 natural
amino acids at all positions were generated and
energy-optimized using foldx [40]. Energy estimates
were calculated with foldx as the DG difference
(DDG) to the reference polyalanine. To retrieve a posi-
tion-specific pseudoenergy matrix for the prediction
scoring function (and calculate S struct ), they averaged
for each amino acid the energies for all its occurrences
at a certain position in combination with all amino
acids at other positions [39].

PAPER: Adapting Proteostasis for Disease Intervention
***********************************
***********************************

The protein components of eukaryotic cells face acute and chronic challenges to their integrity.
Eukaryotic protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, enables healthy cell and organismal development
and aging and protects against disease

Proteostasis refers to controlling the con-
centration, conformation, binding interac-
tions (quaternary structure), and location
of individual proteins making up the proteome
by readapting the innate biology of the cell, often
through transcriptional and translational changes
