FOLDING
*****************************************


The emerging view of folding is that it is a stochastic process, but one biased by the fact that native-like interactions between residues are on average more stable than non-native ones.

In order to achieve the native state encoded by the fold, the protein molecule has to find its way to this unique conformation rather than one of the countless alternatives. 
Contemplation of this problem gave rise to the `Levinthal paradox'. The solution to this apparent paradox has emerged
recently through the consideration of the energy surfaces
or `landscapes' on which the folding reaction occurs.
The energy surface is itself determined from the
sequence, and the key feature of any sequence that can
fold successfully is that the shape of its energy surface is
such that all, or at least the large majority, of the folding
routes, or trajectories, lead efficiently to the single lowest
energy conformation, the native state.
The transition
states of proteins appear to be similar in proteins of
similar native state topology, even if the speci¢c sequences
are unrelated, and the rates of folding can be correlated
with the pattern of the inter-residue contacts formed
within di¡erent structures

This approach recognizes that
folding should be considered as a
biased search on an energy surface that is generally
rather flat, i.e. where there are many conformations of
similar energy.


This process is, however, a stochastic one, and diferent members of the initial conformational
ensemble form their stabilizing contacts in very diferent
orders.


The bias in folding arises because on average the `correct', i.e. native-like, contacts between residues are more stable than `incorrect', or non-native, interactions in any protein that can fold successfully. On this statistical or `new view' of protein folding, a given polypeptide chain within the ensemble of conformations making up the denatured state samples only a small number of conformations during its biased search of conformational space, leading it to increasingly lower energy



The folding of small proteins, typically those of less
than about 100 residues, appears to be limited by the time
required to search for the crucial interactions that are
needed to permit rapid progression to the native struc-
ture. For larger proteins, however, the folding process is
typically more complex, and is usually associated with
the population of one or more partially folded inter-
mediate states. The reason for this is likely to be that
larger polypeptide chains have a greater tendency to
collapse to a compact state in aqueous solution, even if
the contacts between residues in such a state are not those
associated with the completely native structure. In such a
situation, the rate-limiting steps in folding can be the
reorganization of inter-residue interactions within a
more-or-less disordered collapsed state.
Within such a state the barriers to reorganization are
likely to be much greater than in extended structures, and
indeed may involve the breaking of non-native contacts
prior to the formation of more stable native ones. This
situation can give rise to complex kinetics, and also to
distinct heterogeneity in the rate at which di¡erent mole-
cules are able to achieve the native structure.

ESTADOS INTERMEDIOS DE PLEGAMIENTO

RANDOM COIL CONFORMATION:
Obviously, to be able to solve the problem of protein folding, it is necessary to first characterize the unfolded state, which represents the starting point of the folding reaction. It is known that the unfolded state represents an ensemble of rapidly interchanging conformations, some of which are extended, and some more compact. It is possible that when stabilizing interactions occur, they induce a more populated ensemble of chain conformations, and, if such structures exist in the unfolded state, they would probably guide the folding process and function as folding-initiation sites.
Even high concentrations of strong denaturants are more likely to constitute poor solvents for protein chains. Thus, globular proteins are never random coils without positional correlations, and biological polypeptide chains represent macromolecular coils below a critical point, even under harsh denaturing conditions.


PRE-MOLTEN GLOBULE:
Let us consider a situation when the thermodynamic quality of the solvent worsens. In this case binary interactions between the monomers become mainly attractive. As a result, the polymer chain partially collapses, leading to an increase in the molecular density and bringing many-body interactions into scene. It has been found that under appropriate conditions, many proteins can
form a specific compact denatured conformation, a premolten globule state It has been found that under appropriate conditions, many proteins can form a specific compact denatured conformation, a premolten globule state. This conformation is characterized by considerable secondary structure, although much less than that of the molten globule. The premolten globule state is considerably less compact than the molten globule, but it is still more compact than the corresponding random coil.
At least some hydrophobic clusters are already formed in the premolten globule state, although there is no globular structure. Finally, the premolten globule and the molten globule are separated by an all-or-none phase transition, reflecting the fact that these partially folded intermediates represent discrete phase states. Importantly, several structural elements of these squeezed coils may occupy nativelike positions [10]. We assume that this compact denatured state might represent a general intermediate in protein folding. 
Obviously, the existence of such a state substantially reduces any search through the conformational space, ensuring rapid folding. Given that this state might comprise a specific nativelike core with burial of hydrophobic residues, the transition from this state to the molten globule one or to the native state would not require significant energy changes and could occur quite easily. It may well be the case that protein folding in vivo involves mostly molten globule and denatured compact states. In this occasion, it would require only slight changes to make the
coil ‘condense onto itself’ and form a globule.


GLOBULAR STATES - NATIVE AND MOLTEN GLOBULE:



****************LO QUE SIGUE ESTA SACADO DE \ref  Understanding Protein Non-Folding

The importance of flexible structure for some proteins emerged from studies on protein folding.
In fact, it has been pointed out that partially structured folding intermediates (such as the molten
globule [35-41] and the pre-molten globule [37,42-44]), which preserve some main elements
of native secondary structure and their approximate mutual positions in 3-D space, but differ
from the rigid globular state by looser packing of side chains and by the dramatic increase in
the mobility of loops and ends of chain, are apparently ideal for some protein functions. The
pre-molten globule is much more compact than the random coil but is less compact and has
less secondary structure as compared to the molten globule (see below for additional
discussion). By adjusting the solvent conditions, many proteins can be made to exist as stable,
artificially induced, molten globules or as stable pre-molten globules, suggesting that these
forms are not always transient folding intermediates [37,38,42-46].

Molten globule formation is likely driven by hydrophobic collapse, but with insufficiently tight
side chain packing to form stable structures [38]. Pre-molten globule formation, on the other
hand, evidently arises due to water being a poor solvent for polypeptides [42,47-49] (see below
for further discussion of this structural form). Recent studies on model homopolymer amino
acids shed additional light on the concept that collapse can be driven by water not being a good
solvent for proteins. Despite their lack of hydrophobic side chains, both polyglycine and
polyglutamine form collapsed forms lacking appreciable secondary structure, likely because
water is a poor solvent for both of these polymers [49-52]. Given the hydrophilic nature of
polyglutamine, these results suggest that collapse from water being a poor solvent is likely to
be a general phenomenon for proteins that lack a significant net charge. Both of these
homopolymers contain dynamic, fluctuating structures that involve rapidly exchanging
hydrogen bonds. While these homopolymers and the pre-molten globule state may share the
property of arising from water being a poor solvent, the latter form contains much more
secondary structure than the former, probably due in part to the presence of hydrophobic side
chains. Further comparisons of various model homopolymers with different pre-molten globule
proteins are needed to better understand their similarities and differences.


Some proteins exist as stable molten globules or as stable pre-molten globules, suggesting that
for these proteins such partially folded forms can be associated with function (e.g., see
[53-58]). Indeed, molten globules have been suggested to be involved in a number of
physiological processes [37,59,60] such as interaction with chaperones [61], protein insertion
into membranes [62,63] and interaction with ligands (summarized in [64,65]). Although
functionality has been attributed to the molten globule- or pre-molten globule-like
conformations for the examples cited above, the major emphasis still remains focused on the
concept that these partially folded structures represent kinetic folding intermediates trapped
by chaperones just after the protein biosynthesis but before proteins become completely fold
or appear as a result of point mutations preventing polypeptides from complete
folding [37,66]. Some other proteins (such as pore-forming domains of some toxins, or proteins
that act as carriers of large hydrophobic ligands) were assumed to have originally a rigid
structure but were forced somehow to denature to fulfill their functions [38,60].
