*****************************************
FOLDING
*****************************************


The emerging view of folding is that it is a stochastic process, but one biased by the fact that native-like interactions between residues are on average more stable than non-native ones.

In order to achieve the native state encoded by the fold, the protein molecule has to find its way to this unique conformation rather than one of the countless alternatives. 
Contemplation of this problem gave rise to the `Levinthal paradox'. The solution to this apparent paradox has emerged
recently through the consideration of the energy surfaces
or `landscapes' on which the folding reaction occurs.
The energy surface is itself determined from the
sequence, and the key feature of any sequence that can
fold successfully is that the shape of its energy surface is
such that all, or at least the large majority, of the folding
routes, or trajectories, lead efficiently to the single lowest
energy conformation, the native state.
The transition
states of proteins appear to be similar in proteins of
similar native state topology, even if the speci¢c sequences
are unrelated, and the rates of folding can be correlated
with the pattern of the inter-residue contacts formed
within di¡erent structures

This approach recognizes that
folding should be considered as a
biased search on an energy surface that is generally
rather flat, i.e. where there are many conformations of
similar energy.


This process is, however, a stochastic one, and diferent members of the initial conformational
ensemble form their stabilizing contacts in very diferent
orders.


The bias in folding arises because on average the `correct', i.e. native-like, contacts between residues are more stable than `incorrect', or non-native, interactions in any protein that can fold successfully. On this statistical or `new view' of protein folding, a given polypeptide chain within the ensemble of conformations making up the denatured state samples only a small number of conformations during its biased search of conformational space, leading it to increasingly lower energy



The folding of small proteins, typically those of less
than about 100 residues, appears to be limited by the time
required to search for the crucial interactions that are
needed to permit rapid progression to the native struc-
ture. For larger proteins, however, the folding process is
typically more complex, and is usually associated with
the population of one or more partially folded inter-
mediate states. The reason for this is likely to be that
larger polypeptide chains have a greater tendency to
collapse to a compact state in aqueous solution, even if
the contacts between residues in such a state are not those
associated with the completely native structure. In such a
situation, the rate-limiting steps in folding can be the
reorganization of inter-residue interactions within a
more-or-less disordered collapsed state.
Within such a state the barriers to reorganization are
likely to be much greater than in extended structures, and
indeed may involve the breaking of non-native contacts
prior to the formation of more stable native ones. This
situation can give rise to complex kinetics, and also to
distinct heterogeneity in the rate at which di¡erent mole-
cules are able to achieve the native structure.

ESTADOS INTERMEDIOS DE PLEGAMIENTO

RANDOM COIL CONFORMATION:
Obviously, to be able to solve the problem of protein folding, it is necessary to first characterize the unfolded state, which represents the starting point of the folding reaction. It is known that the unfolded state represents an ensemble of rapidly interchanging conformations, some of which are extended, and some more compact. It is possible that when stabilizing interactions occur, they induce a more populated ensemble of chain conformations, and, if such structures exist in the unfolded state, they would probably guide the folding process and function as folding-initiation sites.
Even high concentrations of strong denaturants are more likely to constitute poor solvents for protein chains. Thus, globular proteins are never random coils without positional correlations, and biological polypeptide chains represent macromolecular coils below a critical point, even under harsh denaturing conditions.


PRE-MOLTEN GLOBULE:
Let us consider a situation when the thermodynamic quality of the solvent worsens. In this case binary interactions between the monomers become mainly attractive. As a result, the polymer chain partially collapses, leading to an increase in the molecular density and bringing many-body interactions into scene. It has been found that under appropriate conditions, many proteins can
form a specific compact denatured conformation, a premolten globule state It has been found that under appropriate conditions, many proteins can form a specific compact denatured conformation, a premolten globule state. This conformation is characterized by considerable secondary structure, although much less than that of the molten globule. The premolten globule state is considerably less compact than the molten globule, but it is still more compact than the corresponding random coil.
At least some hydrophobic clusters are already formed in the premolten globule state, although there is no globular structure. Finally, the premolten globule and the molten globule are separated by an all-or-none phase transition, reflecting the fact that these partially folded intermediates represent discrete phase states. Importantly, several structural elements of these squeezed coils may occupy nativelike positions [10]. We assume that this compact denatured state might represent a general intermediate in protein folding. 
Obviously, the existence of such a state substantially reduces any search through the conformational space, ensuring rapid folding. Given that this state might comprise a specific nativelike core with burial of hydrophobic residues, the transition from this state to the molten globule one or to the native state would not require significant energy changes and could occur quite easily. It may well be the case that protein folding in vivo involves mostly molten globule and denatured compact states. In this occasion, it would require only slight changes to make the
coil ‘condense onto itself’ and form a globule.


GLOBULAR STATES - NATIVE AND MOLTEN GLOBULE:



****************LO QUE SIGUE ESTA SACADO DE \ref  Understanding Protein Non-Folding

The importance of flexible structure for some proteins emerged from studies on protein folding.
In fact, it has been pointed out that partially structured folding intermediates (such as the molten
globule [35-41] and the pre-molten globule [37,42-44]), which preserve some main elements
of native secondary structure and their approximate mutual positions in 3-D space, but differ
from the rigid globular state by looser packing of side chains and by the dramatic increase in
the mobility of loops and ends of chain, are apparently ideal for some protein functions. The
pre-molten globule is much more compact than the random coil but is less compact and has
less secondary structure as compared to the molten globule (see below for additional
discussion). By adjusting the solvent conditions, many proteins can be made to exist as stable,
artificially induced, molten globules or as stable pre-molten globules, suggesting that these
forms are not always transient folding intermediates [37,38,42-46].

Molten globule formation is likely driven by hydrophobic collapse, but with insufficiently tight
side chain packing to form stable structures [38]. Pre-molten globule formation, on the other
hand, evidently arises due to water being a poor solvent for polypeptides [42,47-49] (see below
for further discussion of this structural form). Recent studies on model homopolymer amino
acids shed additional light on the concept that collapse can be driven by water not being a good
solvent for proteins. Despite their lack of hydrophobic side chains, both polyglycine and
polyglutamine form collapsed forms lacking appreciable secondary structure, likely because
water is a poor solvent for both of these polymers [49-52]. Given the hydrophilic nature of
polyglutamine, these results suggest that collapse from water being a poor solvent is likely to
be a general phenomenon for proteins that lack a significant net charge. Both of these
homopolymers contain dynamic, fluctuating structures that involve rapidly exchanging
hydrogen bonds. While these homopolymers and the pre-molten globule state may share the
property of arising from water being a poor solvent, the latter form contains much more
secondary structure than the former, probably due in part to the presence of hydrophobic side
chains. Further comparisons of various model homopolymers with different pre-molten globule
proteins are needed to better understand their similarities and differences.


Some proteins exist as stable molten globules or as stable pre-molten globules, suggesting that
for these proteins such partially folded forms can be associated with function (e.g., see
[53-58]). Indeed, molten globules have been suggested to be involved in a number of
physiological processes [37,59,60] such as interaction with chaperones [61], protein insertion
into membranes [62,63] and interaction with ligands (summarized in [64,65]). Although
functionality has been attributed to the molten globule- or pre-molten globule-like
conformations for the examples cited above, the major emphasis still remains focused on the
concept that these partially folded structures represent kinetic folding intermediates trapped
by chaperones just after the protein biosynthesis but before proteins become completely fold
or appear as a result of point mutations preventing polypeptides from complete
folding [37,66]. Some other proteins (such as pore-forming domains of some toxins, or proteins
that act as carriers of large hydrophobic ligands) were assumed to have originally a rigid
structure but were forced somehow to denature to fulfill their functions [38,60].


































RELACION ENTRE AGREGACION Y  IUPs:
Since many completely or partially disordered proteins, especially hubs, play key roles in
regulation and coordination of almost all the biochemical processes inside the cell, their
misfolding can be pathogenic. This fact provides a new view on the molecular mechanisms
of the diseases associated with amyloid fibril formation. In contrast to the globular proteins,
which have to unfold prior to aggregation (Jahn and Radford, 2005), IDPs are always ready
for intermolecular interactions. An unbound fragment of an IDP possesses a strong ability to
interact, and therefore can bind either to natural partners forming native complexes or to
similar molecules forming various aggregates. This raises the question of why IDPs do not
always form aggregates in the norm. One of the potential answers is the fact that inside the
cell, the IDPs typically form complexes with natural partners.
Furthermore, nature developed very sophisticated protection mechanisms (chaperones,
proteasome, etc.) for the effective prevention of dangerous consequences of misfolding. In
other words, in the cell, any given protein is not acting in the isolation, is never alone and is
constantly "watched" by the protective machinery. This machinery is rather robust and can
tolerate significant loads. Obviously, factors that affect these protective mechanisms will
contribute to the probability of disease development (see below). Finally, based on the
analysis of the IDP amino acid composition, it would be clearly a mistake to assume that an
averaged IDP possesses higher propensity towards aggregation than an averaged ordered
protein. In fact, many IDPs contain large number of charged and polar residues. In addition
to the hydrophobic interactions, the net charge is one of the major factors determining
aggregation behavior of a protein.
Many proteins tend to aggregate when the net charge is
zero (at their respective pIs); i.e., under the conditions where the repulsion between the
various protein molecules is minimized (Chiti, 2006). However, since IDPs are often
characterized by extreme pIs (which can be as low as pH 3.0 and as high as pH 12.0) it
would be very difficult for them to reach the conditions of zero net charge physiologically.
This means that evolution worked against misfolding and aggregation, and the sequences of
IDPs were selected so that they do not misfold and aggregate easily.

LINEAR MOTIFS:



INTRODUCCION, ORIGEN EVOLUTIVO, FUNCION, ETC:



Linear motifs are short: between three and ten amino acids,
of which usually just two or three are important for function.
This makes them fundamentally different from domains in
terms of how they arise or how long they tend to be conserved
over evolutionary lineages.
Domains face tough requirements
of being able to fold into a stable, globular structure and enact
a specific function. When duplicated they face the additional
challenge of evolving a new function before being lost [2]. Lin-
ear motifs, in contrast, are very likely to arise or disappear by
chance: just one mutation can change an inert stretch of se-
quence into a functional linear motif, or cause a functional site
to become inactive. This gives them a certain evolutionary
plasticity missing from protein domains.
For critical interactions, this plasticity is risky, since a sin-
gle mutation can remove a critical interaction.
The overall consequence of the above is a poor general con-
servation of instances of linear motifs.

In the sense that they are modular, or repeated in many dif-
ferent contexts, linear motifs are similar to domains. However,
they differ in one critical aspect: whereas domains are now ac-
cepted only to arise by gene duplication, linear motifs, because
of their short length, can easily arise convergently.The fact
that they are defined by only a handful (usually 2–4) fixed ami-
no acids makes them very likely to arise or disappear by muta-
tions.


The short length and the fact that they are rarely conserved
over long evolutionary distances makes linear motifs difficult
to find computationally, or to detect in the laboratory.


what do they mean for Nature?
The low-affinity probably means that Nature herself is just a little bit fuzzy on what
she considers to be a functional instance of a motif. As men-
tioned above, localization and regulation of expression could
reduce the number of accessible functional sites, but the ques-
tion nevertheless arises as to why such a system exists in Nature
at all? The best explanation is probably plasticity: such a fuzzy
network of interactions lends itself well to fast adaptation. Lin-
ear motifs can be switched on or off relatively easily by point
mutations, and their redundancy and weak affinity probably
means that the loss or gain of one will only rarely have drastic
consequences on the evolving system.









RELACION ENTRE IUPs AND LINEAR MOTIFs:

******LA HIPOTESIS INICIAL ES QUE EL MECANISMO SUBYACENTE DE FUNCIONAMIENTO DE LOS LMs ES EXACTAMENTE EL MISMO QUE EL QUE FUE ASIGNADO A LOS ELEMENTOS(MoREs???) de las IUPs.

INTRODUCCION:
LMs represent a functionally very heterogeneous group, with proteins involved in either distinct post-translational modification reactions, or transient/permanent binding of other cellular constituents.
Dynamics of the cell is ensured by the information flow across precisely regulated protein–protein interaction networks. This process requires efficient communication between the partici pating proteins realized via their interactions. In classical terms, this is achieved via a tight, high-affinity fit of protein domains that possess stable three-dimensional structures. Evolution of such globular domains, however, is slower than that of short sequential motifs of a linear arrangement of specificity determinants. These latter, due to relying on a very few confined residues and limited structural constraints, may frequently arise and disappear by point mutations, and confer extreme adaptability to the interactome.
The resulting low affinity complexes are characterized by fast on and off binding rates that may serve regulatory purposes. Our interest was grasped by the fact that these very same features and functional advantages are repeatedly ascribed to IUPs, proteins or protein domains that function without a stable structure. Key advantages of LMs reside in that they facilitate the communication between proteins by having less stringent requirements for association. The resulting lowaffinity complexes are characterized by fast on and off binding rates that may serve regulatory purposes.
The overlap, or possible mutual correspondence, of LMs and short recognition elements in IUPs is of significant appeal. ((( los short recog. elements son los elementos funcionales de las IUPs????????))) 
The recent recognition that alternative splicing preferentially occurs in locally disordered regions of proteins, and removes short recognition elements (Romero et al., 2006) extends the range of this possible correspondence. These examples raised the question if the molecular action of all LMs is based on the same principle of short recognition elements in unstructured regions.
 *****LA HIPOTESIS ES QUE SON LO MISMO......... AL MENOS EN ALGUNOS CASOS, O PARA ALGUNAS FUNCIONALIDADES !!! !!!!!!!!!!! ******




ESTUDIO DE DESORDEN:
Linear motif-domain interactions are a subset of induced fit interactions, where the templated structure is induced in a short peptide of only a few residues. As a
consequence of the small number of residues involved, such interactions tend to be transient and have low binding affinities.
Therefore, they are well suited for mediating functions that require a fast response to changing stimuli. 
A classical example is the dynamic interaction between a kinase and its phosphorylation site: the kinase domain needs to bind to the peptide, attach the phosphate, and then dissociate again, potentially to then go on to interact in a similar way with other substrates.

The rationale of the connection between LMs(linear motifs) and intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins(IUPs/IDPs), is that the latters are frequently associated with
regulatory functions in signal transduction or transcription in eukaryotic proteomes. These functions are carried out by molecular recognition that is linked to a binding-coupled
folding process
Para realizar este analisis,se predice el desorden de LMs and their flanking regions en todos los ejemplos de LMs que fueron caracaterizados experimentalmente y estan en la base de datos
de Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM).
El analisis de desorden se hacen utilizando 2 herramientas seleccionadas de entre todas las herramientas existentes. Las herramientas de analisis utilizadas fueron IUPred y PONDR VSL1.
En todos los casos se obtiene que, tanto los LMs como las regiones flanquentes son preferentemente desestructuradas: the two predictors provide the consensus result that
the average score for LMs and their approximately 20 residue long flanking segments on both sides is above 0.5, i.e. these regions can be considered as intrinsically disordered
Un detalle es que IUPred predice un pico ´hacia abajo´ en el punto central del LM(indicando una region mas estructurada que su contexto). 
Tal irregularity in the disorder pattern was suggested to indicate a transient structural element that can facilitate binding.

Within LMs, however, the uniformity breaks down as the IUP-like attributes mostly apply to the variable residues
(non-restricted sites, NRSs), whereas specificity-determinant
conserved (consensus) residues (restricted sites, RSs) take on
the character of ordered, globular proteins. In general, LMs
appear to have been constructed by grafting residues prone to
be involved in protein-protein interactions onto a principally
unstructured carrier sequence. Whereas this design of embed-
ding appears to hold for the majority of LMs studied here, we
must not overlook that there are exceptions mostly occuring in
proteins associated with non-regulatory functions, where both
the LM and the neighboring environment can adopt a well-
defined fold.



ESTUDIO DE LA COMPOSICION DE LMs
The composition of LMs, as well as their 20-residue flanking segments shows significant deviations from the composition of globular proteins. 
Flanking regions are fairly similar to IUPs: they are enriched in flexible (disorder-promoting) amino acids, whereas depleted in hydrophobic and rigid (order-promoting) residues. 
On the other hand, they have considerably less charged residues than unstructured proteins, while they exhibit a larger excess of a small, polar residue, serine. 

LMs themselves have a unique amino acid composition, dissimilar to either globular or unstructured proteins, being abundant in both floppy and rigid residues, while depleted in amino acids of
medium flexibility. LMs are enriched in hydrophobic residues W, L, F and Y as well as in charged residues R, and D, likely to play distinguished role in partner recognition. 
They are conspicuously depleted in G and A, possibly to simultaneously curb flexibility (G) and the overt tendency to form secondary structural elements (A), while preserving an open but structurally somewhat constrained state. The prevalence of proline in both LMs and their flanking segments underscores this logic due to its preference for an extended secondary structure motif, the polyproline-II helix.

The sequence of LMs can be dissected, as typical motifs are defined by a short sequence pattern , in which certain residues are of restricted identity (usualmente serve as specificity
determinants of the LM), whereas others are of unrestricted identity (likely act as spacers).
As anticipated, the compositions of these sites are markedly different, which is responsible for the aforementioned peculiarity of LM propensities.

Overall, the amino acid composition reveals the mixed nature of LMs and their embedding environments as extended disordered regions (flanking + NRSs), onto which a few specificity-determinant
residues (RSs) have been grafted.

One of the characteristic features that distinguish IUPs from globular proteins is their high mean net charge and low mean hydrophobicity.
Una propiedad interesante es que, dentro de los LMs, a level of net charge both in RS and NRS positions exceeding even that of IUPs can be observed.

These charge/hydrophathy ratios unveil the functional relevance of the unique amino acid composition of LMs: the high propensity of both hydrophobicity and charge at RS positions
reflects their distinguished role as contacting residues in recognition, with interspersed variable positions selected more for flexibility/malleability. This pattern may also reveal an evolutionary compensatory mechanism, in which increased hydrophobicity brought about by residues involved in critical interactions(al aprecer, para cumplir ciertas funciones de interaccion son necesarios ciertos residuos que tambien favorecen el orden, cosa que no es favorable ya que estos motivos tienden al desorden) has been compensated by an increased net charge of LM, preserving a significant tendency of disorder despite the presence of residues, which strongly favor order.
En general, specificity determinant positions are abundant in hydrophobic and charged residues, and in many respects resemble globular proteins, whereas variable residues approximate features of IUPs. As a consequence, a local drop in plasticity is observed in the disorder profile computed by the IUPred method.


RESULTADOS - CONCLUSIONES - DISCUSION:
Our results suggest that LMs and molecular recognition
elements of IUPs significantly overlap, and in the majority of
cases represent an equivalent set of motifs in modular proteins.
The two definitions correspond to each other such as for
phosphorylation sites or calmodulin-binding regions, and is
expected to be so for more regulatory sites. In the case of
association of metabolic proteins however, they likely conform
to different concepts.

Basandose en el patron estructural encontrado (the LM with its flanking region is a locally unstructured segment of the protein, onto which a couple of conserved, mostly hydrophobic, specificity-determinant residues are grafted.) se propone que los LM, junto con las secuencias flanqueantes forman una unidad funcional 
structural pattern, we propose
that LMs together with their flanking segments form a larger
functional unit that can be considered as a super-secondary
structural element. Such elements classically correspond to structural/functional units within globular proteins, exemplified by the helix-turn-helix motif in DNA recognition 
or the alfa-beta-alfa fold in nucleotide coenzyme binding. These elements are defined by a conserved spatial arrangement of secondary structural elements, maintained by a characteristic amino acid composition. 
The super-secondary element encompassing LMs, as defined here, conforms to this definition, as it consists of a functional unit composed of three structurally defined parts: a
short, locally structured segment sandwiched between two disordered regions. The properties of the unstructured stretches are determined solely by their amino acid composition(ver estudios sobre la composicion en los parrafos anteriores), while the actual primary sequence is critical only for the central part. This is not only an evolutionary economical solution to modulate protein-protein interactions, but also provides various benefits in the recognition process itself.

The ensuing binding mode, where determinant residues serve as contact sites, while variable residues within the LM as well as in its flanking environment ensures their proper orientation, has
been often implicated in the interactions of IUPs with their partners, in the form of short recognition elements, described in various contexts as preformed structural elements, primary contact sites or molecular recognition elements (ACA YA HAY UN PARECIDO EN EL MECANISMO).
Besides a proper control on the thermodynamics of binding, this binding mode also enables an increased speed of recognition, also formulated in mechanistic models such as protein fishing or fly-casting. 
These considerations argue that the molecular action of LMs is intertwined(entrelazada) with the structural malleability of their embedding environment. Flanking segments enable the effective recognition of the target site that results in low-affinity contacts, which are of high specificity but readily reversible. Such modes of interactions are of significant benefit in regulation, signaling and network organization functions,

According to this scenario, the molecular mode of action of LMs and recognition elements of IUPs overlap, and probably reflect a similar phenomenon viewed from different angles thus far.

Whereas LMs have been identified as short sequence motifs critical in recognition functions, primary contact sites, preformed structural elements and molecular recognition elments/features have been approached from the direction of protein disorder, emphasizing recognition segments embedded in such regions. Unity of these concepts is underlined by the key role of a few specificity determinants in all these recognition elements, and also by their local preferences for undergoing disorder-to-order transition upon molecular recognition, which might already
be manifested prior to binding. 
Apart from a minority of the cases when LMs are constituted of segments of ordered domains, these different concepts of short recognition elements express the same underlying physical and
functional principles that provide a probably widespread solution to the dynamic control of protein-protein interaction networks.
