This picture enables us to speculate on the origins of
the amyloid diseases from the point of view of the
physico-chemical properties of the protein molecules. If
the stability or cooperativity of the native state of a
protein is reduced, for example by a mutation, the popu-
lation of non-native states will increase.
This rise will increase the probability of aggregation, as the
concentration of polypeptide chains with at least partial
exposure to the external environment will be greater.
Whether or not aggregation does occur will depend on
the concentration of protein molecules, the intrinsic
propensity for a given sequence to aggregate when
unfolded, and on the rate of the aggregation process. The
fact that formation of ordered amyloid ¢brils can be
seeded, like the well-studied processes of crystallization
and gelation, means that once the aggregation process is
initiated it often proceeds very much more rapidly.
In the absence of seeding there can be
long `lag' phases before aggregation occurs .
This lag can be thought of as arising because the growth
of a ¢bril cannot occur until a `nucleus' of a small number
of aggregated molecules is formed. Such a nucleus can be
formed by the local £uctuations in concentration that
occur in solution as a result of random molecular motion.
When such fluctuations result in a local concentration of
molecules above a critical value, the molecules associate
with one other to form a species that is su¤ciently large
to have intrinsic stability, and hence to grow in size by
interacting with other molecules in the solution. The act
of seeding provides such nuclei to the solution and hence
reduces or abolishes the lag phase

The proposal that amyloid fibrils are a generic structure of polypeptide chains (se desarrolla mas adelante en la parte de amyloids) coincide con esta forma de ver.

FOLDED PROTEINS (CONFORMACION PLEGADA)
***************************************

FOLDING
The emerging view of folding is that it is a stochastic process, but one biased by the fact that native-like interactions between residues are on average more stable than non-native ones.
The sequences of natural proteins have emerged through evolutionary processes such that their unique native states can be found very e¤ciently even in the complex
environment inside a living cell.

In vivo, the beginning of the folding process is the nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome. In vitro, folding begins from a fully formed polypeptide chain that has been unfolded, usually by addition of a chemical denaturant such as urea. In both cases the polypeptide chain is highly disordered before folding is initiated. In the extreme case, approximated rather well for many proteins in denaturants, the protein is said to be in a `random coil' state, where only local steric interactions constrain the conformations adopted by the molecule.

In order to achieve the native state encoded by the fold, the protein molecule has to find its way to this unique conformation rather than one of the countless alternatives. Contemplation of this problem gave rise to the `Levinthal paradox'. The solution to this apparent paradox has emerged
recently through the consideration of the energy surfaces
or `landscapes' on which the folding reaction occurs.
The energy surface is itself determined from the
sequence, and the key feature of any sequence that can
fold successfully is that the shape of its energy surface is
such that all, or at least the large majority, of the folding
routes, or trajectories, lead efficiently to the single lowest
energy conformation, the native state.
The transition
states of proteins appear to be similar in proteins of
similar native state topology, even if the speci¢c sequences
are unrelated, and the rates of folding can be correlated
with the pattern of the inter-residue contacts formed
within di¡erent structures

This approach recognizes that
folding should be considered as a
biased search on an energy surface that is generally
rather flat, i.e. where there are many conformations of
similar energy.


This process is, however, a stochastic one, and diferent members of the initial conformational
ensemble form their stabilizing contacts in very diferent
orders.


The bias in folding arises because on average the `correct', i.e. native-like, contacts between residues are more stable than `incorrect', or non-native, interactions in any protein that can fold successfully. On this statistical or `new view' of protein folding, a given polypeptide chain within the ensemble of conformations making up the denatured state samples only a small number of conformations during its biased search of conformational space, leading it to increasingly lower energy



The folding of small proteins, typically those of less
than about 100 residues, appears to be limited by the time
required to search for the crucial interactions that are
needed to permit rapid progression to the native struc-
ture. For larger proteins, however, the folding process is
typically more complex, and is usually associated with
the population of one or more partially folded inter-
mediate states. The reason for this is likely to be that
larger polypeptide chains have a greater tendency to
collapse to a compact state in aqueous solution, even if
the contacts between residues in such a state are not those
associated with the completely native structure. In such a
situation, the rate-limiting steps in folding can be the
reorganization of inter-residue interactions within a
more-or-less disordered collapsed state.
Within such a state the barriers to reorganization are
likely to be much greater than in extended structures, and
indeed may involve the breaking of non-native contacts
prior to the formation of more stable native ones. This
situation can give rise to complex kinetics, and also to
distinct heterogeneity in the rate at which di¡erent mole-
cules are able to achieve the native structure.






The number of observations of both stable and transient partially folded
intermediates is now sufficient for us to assume that all proteins, under
the appropriate conditions, will form such species. These intermediates
are characterized by substantial secondary structure and little tertiary
structure; a collapsed conformation more compact than the unfolded
state; exposed hydrophobic surfaces, which lead to binding of hydrophobic dyes and a propensity to aggregate; and a heat capacity similar
to that of the unfolded state. The term compact intermediates encom­
passes a broad range of conformations and degrees of folding and com­
pactness: compact intermediates have no single, unique conformation,
but rather a whole plethora of structures that range from being very
similar to the native state to being substantially expanded and signifi­
cantly unfolded. The properties of compact intermediates from differ­
ent proteins, and in some cases from the same protein under different
conditions, may be significantly different. Equilibrium compact inter­
mediates may be good models for transient intermediates formed during
folding

Sufficient numbers of different proteins forming stable-equilib­
rium, partially folded conformations have been observed that we can
make the generalization that all proteins, urider the appropriate condi­
tions, will form such species.


Como se dijo antes, esta conformación plegada es algo que se adopta luego de un proceso de plegado, por lo tanto puede dividirse en distintos estados (intermedios??), aparte del estado nativo ordenado.


RANDOM COIL CONFORMATION:
Obviously, to be able to solve the problem of protein folding, it is necessary to first characterize the unfolded state, which represents the starting point of the folding reaction. It is known that the unfolded state represents an ensemble of rapidly interchanging conformations, some of which are extended, and some more compact. It is possible that when stabilizing interactions occur, they induce a more populated ensemble of chain conformations, and, if such structures exist in the unfolded state, they would probably guide the folding process and function as folding-initiation sites.
Even high concentrations of strong denaturants are more likely to constitute poor solvents for protein chains. Thus, globular proteins are never random coils without positional correlations, and biological polypeptide chains represent macromolecular coils below a critical point, even under harsh denaturing conditions.


PRE-MOLTEN GLOBULE:
Let us consider a situation when the thermodynamic quality of the solvent worsens. In this case binary interactions between the monomers become mainly attractive. As a result, the polymer chain partially collapses, leading to an increase in the molecular density and bringing many-body interactions into scene. It has been found that under appropriate conditions, many proteins can
form a specific compact denatured conformation, a premolten globule state It has been found that under appropriate conditions, many proteins can form a specific compact denatured conformation, a premolten globule state. This conformation is characterized by considerable secondary structure, although much less than that of the molten globule. The premolten globule state is considerably less compact than the molten globule, but it is still more compact than the corresponding random coil.
At least some hydrophobic clusters are already formed in the premolten globule state, although there is no globular structure. Finally, the premolten globule and the molten globule are separated by an all-or-none phase transition, reflecting the fact that these partially folded intermediates represent discrete phase states. Importantly, several structural elements of these squeezed coils may occupy nativelike positions [10]. We assume that this compact denatured state might represent a general intermediate in protein folding. 
Obviously, the existence of such a state substantially reduces any search through the conformational space, ensuring rapid folding. Given that this state might comprise a specific nativelike core with burial of hydrophobic residues, the transition from this state to the molten globule one or to the native state would not require significant energy changes and could occur quite easily. It may well be the case that protein folding in vivo involves mostly molten globule and denatured compact states. In this occasion, it would require only slight changes to make the
coil ‘condense onto itself’ and form a globule.


GLOBULAR STATES - NATIVE AND MOLTEN GLOBULE:



****************LO QUE SIGUE ESTA SACADO DE \ref  Understanding Protein Non-Folding

The importance of flexible structure for some proteins emerged from studies on protein folding.
In fact, it has been pointed out that partially structured folding intermediates (such as the molten
globule [35-41] and the pre-molten globule [37,42-44]), which preserve some main elements
of native secondary structure and their approximate mutual positions in 3-D space, but differ
from the rigid globular state by looser packing of side chains and by the dramatic increase in
the mobility of loops and ends of chain, are apparently ideal for some protein functions. The
pre-molten globule is much more compact than the random coil but is less compact and has
less secondary structure as compared to the molten globule (see below for additional
discussion). By adjusting the solvent conditions, many proteins can be made to exist as stable,
artificially induced, molten globules or as stable pre-molten globules, suggesting that these
forms are not always transient folding intermediates [37,38,42-46].

Molten globule formation is likely driven by hydrophobic collapse, but with insufficiently tight
side chain packing to form stable structures [38]. Pre-molten globule formation, on the other
hand, evidently arises due to water being a poor solvent for polypeptides [42,47-49] (see below
for further discussion of this structural form). Recent studies on model homopolymer amino
acids shed additional light on the concept that collapse can be driven by water not being a good
solvent for proteins. Despite their lack of hydrophobic side chains, both polyglycine and
polyglutamine form collapsed forms lacking appreciable secondary structure, likely because
water is a poor solvent for both of these polymers [49-52]. Given the hydrophilic nature of
polyglutamine, these results suggest that collapse from water being a poor solvent is likely to
be a general phenomenon for proteins that lack a significant net charge. Both of these
homopolymers contain dynamic, fluctuating structures that involve rapidly exchanging
hydrogen bonds. While these homopolymers and the pre-molten globule state may share the
property of arising from water being a poor solvent, the latter form contains much more
secondary structure than the former, probably due in part to the presence of hydrophobic side
chains. Further comparisons of various model homopolymers with different pre-molten globule
proteins are needed to better understand their similarities and differences.


Some proteins exist as stable molten globules or as stable pre-molten globules, suggesting that
for these proteins such partially folded forms can be associated with function (e.g., see
[53-58]). Indeed, molten globules have been suggested to be involved in a number of
physiological processes [37,59,60] such as interaction with chaperones [61], protein insertion
into membranes [62,63] and interaction with ligands (summarized in [64,65]). Although
functionality has been attributed to the molten globule- or pre-molten globule-like
conformations for the examples cited above, the major emphasis still remains focused on the
concept that these partially folded structures represent kinetic folding intermediates trapped
by chaperones just after the protein biosynthesis but before proteins become completely fold
or appear as a result of point mutations preventing polypeptides from complete
folding [37,66]. Some other proteins (such as pore-forming domains of some toxins, or proteins
that act as carriers of large hydrophobic ligands) were assumed to have originally a rigid
structure but were forced somehow to denature to fulfill their functions [38,60].



















***********************
MISFOLDED PROTEINS
***********************

As the size and complexity of proteins increase, there-
fore, the folding process becomes more complex. Inter-
mediates with only partially formed structures can be
populated and have significant lifetimes. In addition,
events that may be termed `misfolding' may take place
during the search for the stable native-like contacts
between residues. That such complexities are seen even in
the benign environment of a dilute solution of a pure
protein suggests that they are even more likely to occur in
the crowded environment of the cell.
Undoubtedly,
molecular chaperones are able to mitigate some of the consequences of this complex behaviour and provide
some protection for the incompletely folded chain. But the idea that proteins can misfold, or
fold to intermediates that may undergo undesirable re-
actions such as aggregation, provides insight into potential
problems that can arise during folding even in the best
designed environments.
Folding and unfolding are also
now known to be coupled to many of the key events in the
functioning of a biological system, including translocation
of proteins across membranes, protein tra¤cking, secre-
tion of extracellular proteins, and the control and regula-
tion of the cell cycle (Radford & Dobson 1999). Thus, the
failure of proteins to fold or to remain folded under
physiological conditions ö is likely to cause malfunctions
and hence disease


Protein misfolding is a wide-spread phenomenon. Any protein with changes in native
structure which affect its normal function is misfolded. Aggregation and formation of
amyloid-specific cross-β structure is only one of the forms of misfolding.
The terms “misfolded” and “aggregated” are not equivalent. The ability of a protein to aggregate and to form fibrils
depends on many factors, including protein sequence and environment.
Not all the partially unfolded conformations have increased propensity to aggregate. In fact, only a small fraction of such conformations is aggregation
prone.


The energy landscape model suggests that some folding intermediates might have structural
elements not present in the final folded state. The appearance of such misfolded
intermediates might initiate protein oligomerization or aggregation


De acuerdo con la forma de ver las distintas conformaciones que se dijo en la introduccion (y que se ve en el grafico conformDiagram.png)
The critical step in the aggregation process is the unfolding of the native structure. 
In the case of most proteins, except the smallest ones discussed at the
beginning of this article, unfolding under physiological
conditions will not generate the type of highly unfolded
states seen in high concentrations of denaturant. Instead
the denatured protein will be more stable in a partially
collapsed `intermediate' state that may well resemble the
folding intermediates observed in the normal folding
process

The intermediates may be important, however,
for another reason in that they are generally much more
soluble than highly unfolded polypeptides, enabling the
concentrations of non-native species to reach those
required for nucleation as described above.









The amyloid conformation reflects an intrinsic conformational
propensity of polypeptides as many proteins can be forced into
amyloid fibrils by manipulating external conditions. However,
amyloid formation is also a sequence-specific process 14,15 .
Under physiological conditions, most peptide sequences derived
from proteins will remain soluble even at high concentrations,
whereas most hydrophobic sequences will invariably aggregate
as amorphous aggregates.
Despite active research, a detailed under-
standing of the molecular principles underlying the transformation
of soluble proteins into amyloid aggregates is still lacking

Several methods have been published recently that attempt to predict aggregation-prone or amyloidogenic regions based on various properties of proteins (TANGO, PASTA, WALTZ, SALSA, aggrescan, zyggregator).Some of these prediction methods try to distinguish amyloid fibril
(ordered aggregates) prediction from amorphous
aggregate prediction, providing also the relevant physi-
cal reasoning and influencing factors.

Owing to the relatively small amount
and diversity of experimentally validated amyloidogenic sequences,
sequence-based prediction algorithms do not possess sufficient
information to distinguish amyloid from amorphous aggregates.
They generally also have rather poor predictive capabilities toward
amyloid sequences from yeast prions and functional amyloids. In
contrast, structure-based homology modeling methods 25,40 can in
principle provide very specific predictions. However, as side-chain
modeling is very sensitive to even modest changes in backbone
conformation, structure-based approaches are also limited by a
shortage of experimentally determined structures 28









From a wide range of in vitro experiments on
peptides and proteins we now know that the formation of
amyloid structures is not a rare phenomenon associated
with a small number of diseases but rather that it reflects a
well-defined structural form of the protein that is an alter-
native to the native state — a form that may in principle be
adopted by many, if not all, polypeptide sequences

Amyloidogenic proteins are quite diverse, with little similarity in
sequence and native three-dimensional structure [1,2].
Additionally, several proteins and peptides not related
to amyloidoses have the potential to form amyloid
fibrils in vitro, suggesting that this ability for structural 
rearrangement and aggregation may be inherent to
proteins.
An increasingly adopted view is that
the ability to form amyloid fibrils is a general property of the
polypeptide backbone (6). Nevertheless, the propensity of a given
polypeptide to form amyloid fibrils depends enormously on amino
acid composition.
Dicho de otra forma: Even though the ability to form amyloid fibrils seems to be generic,
the propensity to do so under given circumstances can vary markedly
between different sequences.








Amorphous β-sheet aggregation, however, is less position-
dependent and can, in principle, be achieved by any sequence that
can adopt an extended conformation, is sufficiently hydrophobic
and has no unsatisfied hydrogens or electostatic groups 18,19 . Thus
β-sheet aggregation can be relatively easily predicted by methods
that evaluate aggregation by evaluating biophysical parameters
over a sequence segment, without the need for considering
position-dependent values of these parameters.







The multiplicity of protein states:
In addition to their functional native structures, protein­s
also populate various other states, including disordered
and partially ordered conformations, and different
aggregate­d assemblies

Although it was evident from early studies that both soluble and fibril-
lar forms of proteins could exist 33 , most attention was
focused on the soluble states that were found to possess
demonstrable biological function.


A combination of experimental and
theoretical studies has clarified how given sequences
define specific free energy surfaces that enable folding 38–40 .
This problem is, however, challenging, as a free energy
surface depends on a very large number of relatively
weak interactions, including hydrogen bonds, electro­
static interactions, dispersion forces and interactions with
solvent molecules that underlie the hydrophobic effect.
Moreover, as we discuss below, in some cases the native
state of a given peptide or protein may not be structured
in a globular form but disordered. Regardless of its nature,
however, the functional native state is likely to only reflect
a local free energy minimum at physiological concentra-
tions, as self-association into aggregated protein spe-
cies may in many cases lower the global free energy 41,42
(BOX 1) . Indeed, the maintenance of protein solubility has
emerged as a central aspect of the more general topic of
protein homeostasis 3,43,44 .



RELACION ENTRE AGREGACION Y  IUPs:
Since many completely or partially disordered proteins, especially hubs, play key roles in
regulation and coordination of almost all the biochemical processes inside the cell, their
misfolding can be pathogenic. This fact provides a new view on the molecular mechanisms
of the diseases associated with amyloid fibril formation. In contrast to the globular proteins,
which have to unfold prior to aggregation (Jahn and Radford, 2005), IDPs are always ready
for intermolecular interactions. An unbound fragment of an IDP possesses a strong ability to
interact, and therefore can bind either to natural partners forming native complexes or to
similar molecules forming various aggregates. This raises the question of why IDPs do not
always form aggregates in the norm. One of the potential answers is the fact that inside the
cell, the IDPs typically form complexes with natural partners.
Furthermore, nature developed very sophisticated protection mechanisms (chaperones,
proteasome, etc.) for the effective prevention of dangerous consequences of misfolding. In
other words, in the cell, any given protein is not acting in the isolation, is never alone and is
constantly "watched" by the protective machinery. This machinery is rather robust and can
tolerate significant loads. Obviously, factors that affect these protective mechanisms will
contribute to the probability of disease development (see below). Finally, based on the
analysis of the IDP amino acid composition, it would be clearly a mistake to assume that an
averaged IDP possesses higher propensity towards aggregation than an averaged ordered
protein. In fact, many IDPs contain large number of charged and polar residues. In addition
to the hydrophobic interactions, the net charge is one of the major factors determining
aggregation behavior of a protein.
Many proteins tend to aggregate when the net charge is
zero (at their respective pIs); i.e., under the conditions where the repulsion between the
various protein molecules is minimized (Chiti, 2006). However, since IDPs are often
characterized by extreme pIs (which can be as low as pH 3.0 and as high as pH 12.0) it
would be very difficult for them to reach the conditions of zero net charge physiologically.
This means that evolution worked against misfolding and aggregation, and the sequences of
IDPs were selected so that they do not misfold and aggregate easily.

***Esto esta en \cite{de2004sequence} ***
A protein has to be partially or fully unfolded to aggregate (1, 2).
Yet, mutations leading to aggregation can alter (9, 10), or not alter
(11, 12), protein stability. Aggregation from some peptides and
proteins involved in relevant amyloidoses, such as type II diabetes
and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, does not require, how-
ever, previous unfolding, because these molecules are largely
unstructured under physiological conditions (2). Nevertheless, most
of the natively unfolded proteins in vivo do not undergo aggregation
(13), indicating that unfolding is necessary, but not sufficient, to
promote aggregation.
Hence, there must be some sequence motifs
that, once they become exposed, are more prone to aggregation
than others. In fact, experimental evidence is compelling in favor of
the hypothesis that small regions of a protein are responsible for its
amyloidogenic behavior



Como se dice, intrinsically disordered proteins are not necessarily prone to aggregation, as
their sequences have usually evolved to maintain the level
of solubility that is required for their optimal function;
for example, through the existence of extensive regions
that are highly abundant in charged and polar groups
that disfavour intermolecular association from a thermo­
dynamic point of view. 
Moreover, as is discussed below,
kinetic barriers to aggregation are crucial in enabling both
globular and disordered proteins to maintain their soluble
and functional states


Many proteins adopt various other biologically rel-
evant conformational states in addition to their native
structure.  These
partially folded protein species are particularly vulner-
able to misfolding and aggregation from which they must
be protected in living systems


Although most common forms of proteins are
soluble, some functional states are insoluble,
for example the fibrillar assemblies that form the cellular
cytoskeleton. Proteins are also, however,
vulnerable to forming a wide variety of non-functional
aggregated species. Indeed, proteins exhibit generic poly­
meric and colloidal patterns of behaviour.
Aggregated forms of proteins can be generally amorphous on an ultra­structural
level. Of particular fascination, however, because of their
remarkable structures and properties, are highly ordered
self-associated species of peptides and proteins, notably
amyloid fibrils and closely related prion-like states.

it has been found that the proteinaceous
deposits extracted from tissues in misfolding diseases
typically have amyloid characteristics.
Remarkably, there is no evident similarity in
the sequences, native structures or functions of the group
of disease-associated proteins.


Normally soluble proteins or peptides convert under
certain conditions into ordered fibrillar aggregates
known as amyloid deposits.

Several observations (por ejemplo que ordinary peptides and proteins can convert
under appropriate laboratory conditions into aggregates with all the characteristics of the amyloid fibrils),
, together with a wide variety of biophysical and computational
studies, led to the suggestion that the amyloid structure
can in principle be adopted by any polypeptide chain.


******* The amyloid state of a protein is therefore generic,
as it is accessible to many different polypeptide chains,
and, unlike the native state, its essential architecture is
not encoded by the amino acid sequence 1,26 , although
the details of its structure and stability can be markedly
sequence-dependent, as we discuss below. ********************


Similar to globular
native states, amyloid structures are closely packed and
highly ordered






****************************************
The healthy state of a cell is characterized by a detailed
balance between the different states that proteins can
populate. Perturbations to such balance, unless they are
kept under strict control, can lead to deleterious events
and disease.
****************************************
It is accepted that misfolding of peptides and proteins cause the
fibrillar aggregates that characterize the group of diseases known
as amyloidoses







FUNCTIONAL AMYLOIDS:
Amyloids are not only associated with disease-related proteins.
Nature also exploits the structural and mechanical properties
of amyloids to regulate biological functions 13 . For example, in
bacteria amyloids such as curli promote biofilm formation and
host invasion, and chaplins in bacteria and hydrophobins in yeast
act as regulators of surface tension of water. Insects and fish
use chorion amyloid as a component of eggshell, and spiders
use spidroins in spider silk. Humans possess at least one func-
tional amyloid protein: Pmel17 is used as a structural scaffold
in melanin synthesis. The strength and flexibility of amyloids
have attracted attention for their use as biomaterials. However,
it remains to be understood how functional amyloids avoid the
cytotoxic effects observed in disease amyloids. In part, functional
amyloids are regulated by chaperones and proteases. But it is
also becoming evident that sequence composition modulates
critical biophysical parameters determining kinetics of assembly
or mechanical strength.

LINEAR MOTIFS:



INTRODUCCION, ORIGEN EVOLUTIVO, FUNCION, ETC:

******GRAN PARTE ESTA EN \CITE(Linear motifs: Evolutionary interaction switches) *********
Proteins are usually modular, containing discrete regions
each of which performs a different sub-function. The most
widely known modular element is the protein domain. These
are typically more than 30 residues in length and fold into
an independent compact structure. More than 7000 domains
are known [1], performing an enormous diversity of functions
from catalysis during metabolism to cell–cell recognition in the
immune system. Domain duplication is now an accepted mech-
anism of evolution, and differences in domain architecture are
often responsible for critical differences between organisms.
Duplications are thought to be followed either by loss of one
copy or the evolution of a new function by point mutations.

However, domains are only part of the picture. Many studies
have shown that they cover only a fraction of the protein se-
quence contained in an organism. The remaining parts of the
sequence only rarely contain undiscovered domains, and in-
deed have been shown to be low-complexity (i.e., dominated
by a few amino acids) or intrinsically disordered (see [3] for re-
view).A fraction of these regions are likely linkers that permit
the correct spacing of domains in a functional protein, though
many others are known to play pivotal functional roles. Crit-
ical sites for phosphorylation, or other modifications often
lie within them, as do regions important for interactions with
other proteins. These very short, functional regions, though
not globular domains, often conform to particular sequence
patterns or linear motifs indicative of a particular function

Despite the availability of
many thousands of sequences, the discovery of linear motifs,
in contrast to domains, has remained difficult. Their short
length makes them difficult to detect using sequence compari-
son procedures that aid domain discovery. They are typically
discovered by difficult and time-consuming experimental pro-
cedures. This usually involves first identifying a set of proteins
sharing a common function (e.g., a common interaction part-
ner or targeting within the cell), and then gradually delineating
a short, common segment associated with this function
through a variety of experimental techniques.

the difficulties in their discovery
mean that only about two hundred linear motifs are known
compared to thousands of domains that might bind them.


Linear motifs are short: between three and ten amino acids,
of which usually just two or three are important for function.
This makes them fundamentally different from domains in
terms of how they arise or how long they tend to be conserved
over evolutionary lineages.
Domains face tough requirements
of being able to fold into a stable, globular structure and enact
a specific function. When duplicated they face the additional
challenge of evolving a new function before being lost [2]. Lin-
ear motifs, in contrast, are very likely to arise or disappear by
chance: just one mutation can change an inert stretch of se-
quence into a functional linear motif, or cause a functional site
to become inactive. This gives them a certain evolutionary
plasticity missing from protein domains.
For critical interactions, this plasticity is risky, since a sin-
gle mutation can remove a critical interaction.
The overall consequence of the above is a poor general con-
servation of instances of linear motifs.

In the sense that they are modular, or repeated in many dif-
ferent contexts, linear motifs are similar to domains. However,
they differ in one critical aspect: whereas domains are now ac-
cepted only to arise by gene duplication, linear motifs, because
of their short length, can easily arise convergently.The fact
that they are defined by only a handful (usually 2–4) fixed ami-
no acids makes them very likely to arise or disappear by muta-
tions.


The short length and the fact that they are rarely conserved
over long evolutionary distances makes linear motifs difficult
to find computationally, or to detect in the laboratory.


what do they mean for Nature?
The low-affinity probably means that Nature herself is just a little bit fuzzy on what
she considers to be a functional instance of a motif. As men-
tioned above, localization and regulation of expression could
reduce the number of accessible functional sites, but the ques-
tion nevertheless arises as to why such a system exists in Nature
at all? The best explanation is probably plasticity: such a fuzzy
network of interactions lends itself well to fast adaptation. Lin-
ear motifs can be switched on or off relatively easily by point
mutations, and their redundancy and weak affinity probably
means that the loss or gain of one will only rarely have drastic
consequences on the evolving system.

INTRODUCCION:
LMs represent a functionally very heterogeneous group, with proteins involved in either distinct post-translational modification reactions, or transient/permanent binding of other cellular constituents.
Dynamics of the cell is ensured by the information flow across precisely regulated protein–protein interaction networks. This process requires efficient communication between the partici pating proteins realized via their interactions. In classical terms, this is achieved via a tight, high-affinity fit of protein domains that possess stable three-dimensional structures. Evolution of such globular domains, however, is slower than that of short sequential motifs of a linear arrangement of specificity determinants. These latter, due to relying on a very few confined residues and limited structural constraints, may frequently arise and disappear by point mutations, and confer extreme adaptability to the interactome.
The resulting low affinity complexes are characterized by fast on and off binding rates that may serve regulatory purposes. Our interest was grasped by the fact that these very same features and functional advantages are repeatedly ascribed to IUPs, proteins or protein domains that function without a stable structure. Key advantages of LMs reside in that they facilitate the communication between proteins by having less stringent requirements for association. The resulting lowaffinity complexes are characterized by fast on and off binding rates that may serve regulatory purposes.
The overlap, or possible mutual correspondence, of LMs and short recognition elements in IUPs is of significant appeal. ((( los short recog. elements son los elementos funcionales de las IUPs????????))) 
The recent recognition that alternative splicing preferentially occurs in locally disordered regions of proteins, and removes short recognition elements (Romero et al., 2006) extends the range of this possible correspondence. These examples raised the question if the molecular action of all LMs is based on the same principle of short recognition elements in unstructured regions.

ESTUDIO DE DESORDEN:
Linear motif-domain interactions are a subset of induced fit interactions, where the templated structure is induced in a short peptide of only a few residues. As a
consequence of the small number of residues involved, such interactions tend to be transient and have low binding affinities.
Therefore, they are well suited for mediating functions that require a fast response to changing stimuli. 
A classical example is the dynamic interaction between a kinase and its phosphorylation site: the kinase domain needs to bind to the peptide, attach the phosphate, and then dissociate again, potentially to then go on to interact in a similar way with other substrates.

The rationale of the connection between LMs(linear motifs) and intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins(IUPs/IDPs), is that the latters are frequently associated with
regulatory functions in signal transduction or transcription in eukaryotic proteomes. These functions are carried out by molecular recognition that is linked to a binding-coupled
folding process
Para realizar este analisis,se predice el desorden de LMs and their flanking regions en todos los ejemplos de LMs que fueron caracaterizados experimentalmente y estan en la base de datos
de Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM).
El analisis de desorden se hacen utilizando 2 herramientas seleccionadas de entre todas las herramientas existentes. Las herramientas de analisis utilizadas fueron IUPred y PONDR VSL1.
En todos los casos se obtiene que, tanto los LMs como las regiones flanquentes son preferentemente desestructuradas: the two predictors provide the consensus result that
the average score for LMs and their approximately 20 residue long flanking segments on both sides is above 0.5, i.e. these regions can be considered as intrinsically disordered
Un detalle es que IUPred predice un pico ´hacia abajo´ en el punto central del LM(indicando una region mas estructurada que su contexto). 
Tal irregularity in the disorder pattern was suggested to indicate a transient structural element that can facilitate binding.

Within LMs, however, the uniformity breaks down as the IUP-like attributes mostly apply to the variable residues
(non-restricted sites, NRSs), whereas specificity-determinant
conserved (consensus) residues (restricted sites, RSs) take on
the character of ordered, globular proteins. In general, LMs
appear to have been constructed by grafting residues prone to
be involved in protein-protein interactions onto a principally
unstructured carrier sequence. Whereas this design of embed-
ding appears to hold for the majority of LMs studied here, we
must not overlook that there are exceptions mostly occuring in
proteins associated with non-regulatory functions, where both
the LM and the neighboring environment can adopt a well-
defined fold.



ESTUDIO DE LA COMPOSICION DE LMs
The composition of LMs, as well as their 20-residue flanking segments shows significant deviations from the composition of globular proteins. 
Flanking regions are fairly similar to IUPs: they are enriched in flexible (disorder-promoting) amino acids, whereas depleted in hydrophobic and rigid (order-promoting) residues. 
On the other hand, they have considerably less charged residues than unstructured proteins, while they exhibit a larger excess of a small, polar residue, serine. 

LMs themselves have a unique amino acid composition, dissimilar to either globular or unstructured proteins, being abundant in both floppy and rigid residues, while depleted in amino acids of
medium flexibility. LMs are enriched in hydrophobic residues W, L, F and Y as well as in charged residues R, and D, likely to play distinguished role in partner recognition. 
They are conspicuously depleted in G and A, possibly to simultaneously curb flexibility (G) and the overt tendency to form secondary structural elements (A), while preserving an open but structurally somewhat constrained state. The prevalence of proline in both LMs and their flanking segments underscores this logic due to its preference for an extended secondary structure motif, the polyproline-II helix.

The sequence of LMs can be dissected, as typical motifs are defined by a short sequence pattern , in which certain residues are of restricted identity (usualmente serve as specificity
determinants of the LM), whereas others are of unrestricted identity (likely act as spacers).
As anticipated, the compositions of these sites are markedly different, which is responsible for the aforementioned peculiarity of LM propensities.

Overall, the amino acid composition reveals the mixed nature of LMs and their embedding environments as extended disordered regions (flanking + NRSs), onto which a few specificity-determinant
residues (RSs) have been grafted.

One of the characteristic features that distinguish IUPs from globular proteins is their high mean net charge and low mean hydrophobicity.
Una propiedad interesante es que, dentro de los LMs, a level of net charge both in RS and NRS positions exceeding even that of IUPs can be observed.

These charge/hydrophathy ratios unveil the functional relevance of the unique amino acid composition of LMs: the high propensity of both hydrophobicity and charge at RS positions
reflects their distinguished role as contacting residues in recognition, with interspersed variable positions selected more for flexibility/malleability. This pattern may also reveal an evolutionary compensatory mechanism, in which increased hydrophobicity brought about by residues involved in critical interactions(al aprecer, para cumplir ciertas funciones de interaccion son necesarios ciertos residuos que tambien favorecen el orden, cosa que no es favorable ya que estos motivos tienden al desorden) has been compensated by an increased net charge of LM, preserving a significant tendency of disorder despite the presence of residues, which strongly favor order.
En general, specificity determinant positions are abundant in hydrophobic and charged residues, and in many respects resemble globular proteins, whereas variable residues approximate features of IUPs. As a consequence, a local drop in plasticity is observed in the disorder profile computed by the IUPred method.


RESULTADOS - CONCLUSIONES - DISCUSION:
Our results suggest that LMs and molecular recognition
elements of IUPs significantly overlap, and in the majority of
cases represent an equivalent set of motifs in modular proteins.
The two definitions correspond to each other such as for
phosphorylation sites or calmodulin-binding regions, and is
expected to be so for more regulatory sites. In the case of
association of metabolic proteins however, they likely conform
to different concepts.

Basandose en el patron estructural encontrado (the LM with its flanking region is a locally unstructured segment of the protein, onto which a couple of conserved, mostly hydrophobic, specificity-determinant residues are grafted.) se propone que los LM, junto con las secuencias flanqueantes forman una unidad funcional 
structural pattern, we propose
that LMs together with their flanking segments form a larger
functional unit that can be considered as a super-secondary
structural element. Such elements classically correspond to structural/functional units within globular proteins, exemplified by the helix-turn-helix motif in DNA recognition 
or the alfa-beta-alfa fold in nucleotide coenzyme binding. These elements are defined by a conserved spatial arrangement of secondary structural elements, maintained by a characteristic amino acid composition. 
The super-secondary element encompassing LMs, as defined here, conforms to this definition, as it consists of a functional unit composed of three structurally defined parts: a
short, locally structured segment sandwiched between two disordered regions. The properties of the unstructured stretches are determined solely by their amino acid composition(ver estudios sobre la composicion en los parrafos anteriores), while the actual primary sequence is critical only for the central part. This is not only an evolutionary economical solution to modulate protein-protein interactions, but also provides various benefits in the recognition process itself.

The ensuing binding mode, where determinant residues serve as contact sites, while variable residues within the LM as well as in its flanking environment ensures their proper orientation, has
been often implicated in the interactions of IUPs with their partners, in the form of short recognition elements, described in various contexts as preformed structural elements, primary contact sites or molecular recognition elements (ACA YA HAY UN PARECIDO EN EL MECANISMO).
Besides a proper control on the thermodynamics of binding, this binding mode also enables an increased speed of recognition, also formulated in mechanistic models such as protein fishing or fly-casting. 
These considerations argue that the molecular action of LMs is intertwined(entrelazada) with the structural malleability of their embedding environment. Flanking segments enable the effective recognition of the target site that results in low-affinity contacts, which are of high specificity but readily reversible. Such modes of interactions are of significant benefit in regulation, signaling and network organization functions,

According to this scenario, the molecular mode of action of LMs and recognition elements of IUPs overlap, and probably reflect a similar phenomenon viewed from different angles thus far.

Whereas LMs have been identified as short sequence motifs critical in recognition functions, primary contact sites, preformed structural elements and molecular recognition elments/features have been approached from the direction of protein disorder, emphasizing recognition segments embedded in such regions. Unity of these concepts is underlined by the key role of a few specificity determinants in all these recognition elements, and also by their local preferences for undergoing disorder-to-order transition upon molecular recognition, which might already
be manifested prior to binding. 
Apart from a minority of the cases when LMs are constituted of segments of ordered domains, these different concepts of short recognition elements express the same underlying physical and
functional principles that provide a probably widespread solution to the dynamic control of protein-protein interaction networks.

PROTEIN FUNCTION:

There are many methods, such as SMART (Simple Modular
Architecture Research Tool) (3), PRODOM (4) , Pfam (5,6),
PROSITE (7) and ELM (Eukaryotic Linear Motif, http://
elm.eu.org) (8), available for finding globular domains (e.g.
SH3, TyrKc, active sites) and linear motifs (e.g. SH3 ligands,
LXXLL nuclear receptor ligands, tyrosine phosphorylation
sites, post-translational modification sites) within a protein
sequence. These methods typically rely on sequence similarity
models, looking for recurrence of known domains or motifs by
such means as HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) (9), pattern
discovery
(http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~stelo/pattern.html)
or
SW(Smith-Waterman)-profiles (10). Although these methods
are of great value in annotating protein sequences, they are
limited in their ability to uncover new features not yet
discovered.

	AMYLOIDs
*************************

All amyloid fibrils share the same cross-beta archi-
tecture and several functional proteins found in bacte-
ria, fungi, insects and humans have also been found to
adopt the same architecture under physiological condi-
tions, as part of their functional role despite the diversity of origin of their
constituent proteins.


Since all fibrils independent of the original structure of the given amyloidogenic protein have a common cross-b structure, considerable conformational rearrangements have to occur prior to fibrillation. Such changes cannot happen in a native protein, due to its stable and rigid tertiary structure. Thus, protein destabilization favoring partial unfolding and culminating in the formation of a partially unfolded conformation is required. Presumably, such a partially unfolded conformation favors reciprocal and specific intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, which are necessary for oligomerization and fibrillation
Obviously, this model does take into account a class of natively unfolded proteins, as they are devoid of rigid tertiary structure in their native state.

A question then arises about the nature of the amyloidogenic intermediate(s). It has been already mentioned that the conformational space of globular proteins involves
four general conformations(random cloil, pre-molten globules,molten globules, native).
Potentially, either of these latter conformations may play a role as the crucial amyloidogenic species. Detailed structural analysis of early fibrillation events in several proteins has demonstrated that the amyloidogenic conformation is only slightly folded and shares many structural properties with the premolten globule state.

Data have been reported indicating that the first critical step in protein fibrillogenesis is the partial unfolding of the protein. Due to structural fluctuations (conformational breathing) the structure of a globular protein under physiological conditions represents a mixture of tightly folded and multiple partially unfolded conformations, with great prevalence of the former. Most mutations associated with accelerated fibrillation and protein deposition diseases have been shown to destabilize the native structure, increasing the steady-state concentration of partially folded conformers


Theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that
short sequence stretches may be responsible for amy-
loid formation [11–13].
