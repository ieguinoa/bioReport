LINKERS NATURALES:





PROPIEDADES ESTRUCTURALES DE LINKERS NATURALES



ABSENCE OF FLEXIBILITY: MOLECULAR RULERS

 





An independent analysis showed that
Thr, Ser, Gly, and Ala are also preferred residues in
natural linkers. 

Besides, flexible Gly-rich regions
have been observed as natural linkers in proteins,
generating loops that connect domains in multido-
main proteins. 
These glycine-rich peptides confer flexibility,
which allows the specific engineering of hinge regions
into proteins to achieve desired functional motions.
Prediction of the flexibility of a hinge
region is based on an understanding of the rotational
freedom of the attached moieties.






**************************
Un buen analisis de linkers naturales se hace en (ref: An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding)
En donde se dividen los linkers en 2 , segun sus propiedades estructurales (de forma muy general):  helical and non-helical.
Helical linkers are
thought to act as rigid spacers separating two domains.
Non-helical linkers are rich in prolines, which also leads
to structural rigidity and isolation of the linker from
the attached domains. This means that both linker types are likely to act as a scaffold to prevent unfavourable interactions between folding domains.

Both the helical and nonhelical linkers
have similar hydrophobicity. Pro is the most common
terminal linker residue followed by Arg, Phe, Thr,
Glu, and Gln in decreasing order of preference. The
probable reason why proline is favored over other
residues in linking different domains is the inability
of proline to donate hydrogen bonds or participate
comfortably in any regular secondary structure con-
formation. This ensures a relatively rigid separation
of the domains, thereby preventing unfavorable con-
tacts between them.



A partir de esta diversidad en las estructuras y propiedades de las secuencias linkers, 
podría decirse que estas secuencias pueden haber sido seleccionados como parte de la evolución de la proteina, para cumplir una funcion en la proteina, 
probablemente a partir de sus propiedades estructurales.
Recent studies have shown that domain linkers can play
an essential role in maintaining cooperative inter-domain
interactions. 


Inter-domain linkers are likely to
facilitate the folding of multidomain proteins: α-helical linkers
are thought to act as rigid spacers to prevent non-native
interactions between domains that may interfere with correct
domain folding. The requirement for stiffness turns out to be
important also for the non-helical linkers: having a large
proportion of proline residues leads to a rigidity of the
polypeptide. Compared to their helical counterparts, non-
helical linkers have evolved further away from intra-domain
segments, to obtain the required rigidity inherent to the α-
helical conformation.
However, prolines can form tight turns or cis-Pro isomers,
which negatively affect domain independence. The chance of
these conformations can be reduced by careful selection of the
preceding residue, and this study confirms that this happens
in nature.

PROPIEDADES DE COMPOSICION, LARGO, ETC. EN LINKERS NATURALES

El primer estudio (creo) que se realizo fue (Argos, 1990) .
Argos carried out a statistical study of natural linkers
with the aim to design independent linkers for gene fusion
that would have a low likelihood of disrupting the folding of
the flanking domains. He constructed a set of 51 linkers from
visual inspection of 32 proteins. The amino acids Thr, Ser,
Pro and Asp were found to be desirable linker constituents.
The author concluded that the preferred linker amino acids are
mostly hydrophilic, often polar and usually small. The majority,
59%, of the linker residues were in coil or bend structures
with a mean length of 6.5 residues, but an average flexibility
when compared to other protein regions. It was suggested that
pentapeptides consisting of only Gly, Ser and Thr would make
the best linkers for gene fusion; as these residues were most
strongly preferred within natural linkers. Differing structures
pointed to the importance of the amino acid order to achieve
an extended and conformationally stable oligopeptide
Este trabajo pointed to the importance of the amino acid order to achieve an extended and conformationally stable oligopeptide.
The analysis by Argos is now slightly outdated since the protein data set used was small and linker delineation had been performed manually.

En el trabajo (\ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding.-George, Heringa), se hace un analisis sobre a much larger data
set, y ademas se desarrolla un metodo automatizado para extraer interdomain linkers from a data set of proteins of known 3D structure. 
Utilizando estos datos, se analizan  the amino acids’ propensities in linkers and examined the preferred order of residues within linkers. 
We have also devised a linker database, which can be used as a starting point to engineer domain fusion.



Mediante mutaciones puntuales o deleciones  sobre una secuencia linker que llevan a reprimir alguna funcionalidad/iteraccion/actividad global de la proteina (Gokhale and Khosla, 2000),
SE DEMUESTRA QUE, NO SOLO LA COMPOSICION SINO TAMBIEN LA LONGITUD DE LA SECUENCIA LINKER SON IMPORTANTES
In general, altering the length of linkers
connecting domains has been shown to affect protein stability,
folding rates and domain–domain orientation








One recent
study showed that a particular flexible linker maintains
its length and flexibility across divergent species despite
having little or no obvious amino acid sequence conser-
vation. Perhaps for this linker, the amino acid composi-
tion is more important than the specific details of the
sequence



the average length of linkers in natural multi-domain proteins was calculated to be
6.5 residues by Argos [23], and 10.0 ± 5.8 residues by George and Heringa (\ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding.
To give insight into the structural environment of the linkers, the average normalized solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity
were also calculated. The data showed higher solvent accessibility with increasing length of
linkers , suggesting that longer linkers were more likely to be exposed to the solvent.
Consistent with these data, the average hydrophobicity of the linkers decreased with the
increase of length, indicating that longer linkers were more hydrophilic and therefore more
exposed in the aqueous solvent than shorter linkers .   ********TODO ESTE ULTIMO PARRAFO SON RESULTADOS DE (\ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding.)






The preference of amino acid residues in natural linkers was also investigated by calculating
the ratio of single amino acid occurrence in the linker and the full protein (Table 1), where
values greater than 1 (shaded) indicate higher occurrences in the linker. By screening the
database, threonine (Thr), serine (Ser), proline (Pro), glycine (Gly), aspartic acid (Asp),
lysine (Lys), glutamine (Gln), asparagine (Asn), and alanine (Ala) were suggested to be
preferable linker constituents by Argos [23], whereas Pro, arginine (Arg), phenylalanine
(Phe), Thr, glutamic acid (Glu) and Gln were preferred in the study by George and Heringa
[24].
Therefore, in general, preferable amino acids were polar uncharged or charged
residues, which constitute approximately 50% of naturally encoded amino acids. Both
studies suggested that Pro, Thr, and Gln were the preferable amino acids for natural linkers.
Among them, Pro is a unique amino acid with a cyclic side chain which causes a very
restricted conformation [25]. The lack of amide hydrogen on Pro may prevent the formation
of hydrogen bonds with other amino acids, and therefore reduces the interaction between the
linkers and the protein domains. As a result, the inclusion of Pro residues might increase the
stiffness and structural independence of the linkers. Many natural multi-domain proteins
contain Pro-rich sequences as interdomain linkers, including the linker between the lipoyl
and E3 binding domain in pyruvate dehydrogenase
The small, polar amino acids, such as Thr (both
studies), or Ser and Gly (Argos’s study), were thought to be favorable because they might
provide good flexibility due to their small sizes, and also help maintain stability of the linker
structure in the aqueous solvent through formation of hydrogen bonds with water.






****ESTE PARRAFO ESTA EN ref: INTRINSICALLY UNSTRUCTURED PROTEINS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS H. Jane Dyson and Peter E. Wright
A characteristic feature of the linkers
is that they are highly conserved between species in
amino-acid composition, but not in sequence. There is
a high proportion of polar residues (~70%) — a per-
centage that is retained from Caenorhabditis elegans to
Homo sapiens — despite significant differences in
linker length. Examination of individual linkers shows
that they sometimes contain embedded regions that
have a high sequence conservation and an increased
content of charged or hydrophobic residues; some of
these segments map to known interaction or regula-
tory motifs and the others are probable candidates for
such functions.
Linkers of the appropriate length and composition seem to be
essential for the correct assembly of large complexes
Changes in the length or composition of the Pro- and
Gln-repeat regions are thought to be a way of modu-
lating transcriptional activation 105 . The presence of
long linker regions in transcriptional-activator pro-
teins such as CBP/p300 (FIG. 2) facilitates the assembly
of the active transcriptional complex through interac-
tions that occur over a distance scale of hundreds to
thousands of angstroms. For example, a linker that is
400 residues in length — such as the one between the
KIX domain and the bromodomain of CBP/p300 —
has the ability to span distances that range from less than
100 Å to more than 1,500 Å. This gives the transcrip-
tional activator the flexibility to interact with numerous
transcriptional-regulatory factors that are bound with
varying geometries over large promoter/enhancer
regions (hundreds to thousands of base pairs). In
addition, it is easy to envisage that flexible linker
regions would facilitate the recruitment of other pro-
tein factors to the complex, through a mechanism
known as ‘fly-casting’ 106

The functions of linker sequences demand that they
are flexible and extended, and have a relatively high
long-term stability. The low proportion of hydrophobic
residues in linkers might be significant for their func-
tion. Misfolded proteins are targeted for destruction in
the cell, and it is thought that the key to this targeting
is the identification of solvated hydrophobic amino
acids by cellular-destruction mechanisms such as the
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Linker sequences must
necessarily be unfolded, but need to be resistant to pro-
teolysis. It is probable that the lack of hydrophobic
residues in linker sequences is related to the require-
ment of an intrinsically unfolded protein segment for
long-term stability. Furthermore, experimentally, it has
been found that polyglutamine repeats are resistant to
degradation by eukaryotic proteasomes, which is 
consistent with the observed accumulation of such
sequences in POLYGLUTAMINE-REPEAT DISORDERS . The particu-
lar amino-acid composition of linker sequences also
stops them folding to form local structures that might
interact nonspecifically with other proteins.
