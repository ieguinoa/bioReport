LINKERS NATURALES:


An important consideration in protein architecture and
function is the flexibility of linkers that interconnect
the various domains in multidomain proteins com-
monly found in many biological processes.
These link-
ers are stretches of amino acid residues that establish
communication between the different domains and the
functional modules

Control of structural flexibility is essential for the proper functioning of a large number
of proteins and multiprotein complexes. At the residue level, such flexibility occurs due to local
relaxation of peptide bond angles whose cumulative effect may result in large changes in the secon-
dary, tertiary or quaternary structures of protein molecules. Such flexibility, and its absence, most
often depends on the nature of interdomain linkages formed by oligopeptides. Both flexible and rela-
tively rigid peptide linkers are found in many multidomain proteins. Linkers are thought to control
favorable and unfavorable interactions between adjacent domains by means of variable softness
furnished by their primary sequence. Large-scale structural heterogeneity of multidomain proteins
and their complexes, facilitated by soft peptide linkers, is now seen as the norm rather than the
exception. Biophysical discoveries as well as computational algorithms and databases have
reshaped our understanding of the often spectacular biomolecular dynamics enabled by soft linkers.
Absence of such motion, as in so-called molecular rulers, also has desirable functional effects in
protein architecture.


El 'descubrimiento' de las regiones/secuencias linkers esta ligado a las teorias de structura-funcion(desarrolladas en la parte de conformacion) que se dieron durante casi 100 años
En un principio se comenzo a pensar en una estructura rigida asociada a la proteina, luego se fueron revelendo propiedades dinamicas que le permitian cumplir la funcion. Todo esto esta muy asociado a las tecnicas experimentales que se fueron desarrollando.

The first X-ray crystallographic structures provided a static picture of protein architecture, but multidomain structures in multiple conformations were soon discovered, where individual domains were connected by flexible linkers.
Analyses of structures(por ej. mediante X.ray diffraction) have shown that protein motion may occur due to conformational changes in individual residues or at the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structural levels. Lactate dehydrogenase, triose-phosphate isomerase, as well as hemoglobin and related proteins are some of the earliest examples of proteins that showed conformational changes with important functional implications.
The concept of hinge-bending, whereby the relative flexibility of short regions of the polypeptide chain allows significant movement of structural domains, gained widespread acceptance in
the 1980s and early 1990s, after evidence for conformational transitions in identical or homologous proteins became known.
According to Dobson, 7 the domains
themselves are closely similar in each case, a fact that
can be attributed to their motion as rigid bodies around
a screw axis.
****VER HINGE REGIONS


Utilizando estos datos, los primeros estudios de analisis (estructura y composicion) de secuencias linkers se comenzaron a hacer a partir del analisis estadistico de secuencias que podian ser clasificadas como linkers a partir de estructuras/secuencias almacenadas en bases de datos de proteinas.
Estos estudios estaban sesgados por todo el proceso historico de descubrimiento marcado por el modelo de estructura-funcion de las proteinas, y el concepto de hinge-bending.

En esos años, many studies of linker peptides in various protein families have come to the conclusion that linkers lack regular secondary structure, they display varying degrees of flexibility to match their particular biological purpose and are rich in Ala, Pro and charged residues

A lo largo de los años los conocimientos sobre la composición y propiedades de estas secuencias ha ido cambiando, 
a medida que mayor cantidad de estructuras se resolvian y mayor conocimiento se obtenia acerca de los dominios que componen las proteinas(ademas tambien influyeron otras cosas como tecnicas de biofisica para obtener informacion estructural en solucion, o algoritmos para automatizar la identificacion de la secuencia que actua como linker en una proteina)

Hoy en dia, solo se puede decir que los linkers naturales son secuencias que actuan como espaciadores entre los dominios de una proteina, de manera que se prevengan interacciones unfavourable between folding domains. Esto solo se puede decir acerca de su definicion, ya que las propiedades dependen de la arquitectura de la proteina.
En cada proteina, la secuencia linker puede tener una estructura y una funcion que haya sido seleccionada para el mecanismo/localizacion/funcion/etc de la proteina como un todo, y esta funcion del linker puede no ser solamente la union covalente de dos dominios para proveer increased stability and new cooperative functions.
Algunos linkers can play an essential role in maintaining cooperative inter-domain interactions
De esta forma, es dificil hacer un analisis y una clasificacion concreta de todos los linkers. Si se pueden agrupar algunos segun distintas caracteristicas funcionales, estructurales, etc.
For example, Q-linkers occur at the boundaries of functionally distinct domains in a variety of bacterial regulatory and sensory transduction proteins, including the nitrogen
regulatory proteins NtrB, NtrC, NifA and NifL (Wootton and Drummond, 1989). Q-linkers are between 15 and 20 residues in length and are not strongly conserved in sequence in otherwise homologous proteins. They have a preference for Gln, Arg, Glu, Ser and Pro residues and adopt a coil structure. Insertion of amino acids within the Q-linker sequence of NtrC
and NifA was found to have no effect on their function (Wootton and Drummond, 1989).





PROPIEDADES ESTRUCTURALES DE LINKERS NATURALES

A partir de estudios de las secuencias linkers naturales se ha encontrado que:


ABSENCE OF FLEXIBILITY: MOLECULAR RULERS

Proline is common to many naturally derived interdomain
linkers, and structural studies indicate that proline-
rich sequences form relatively rigid extended struc-
tures to prevent unfavorable interactions between
the domains.  
The probable reason why proline is favored over other
residues in linking different domains is the inability
of proline to donate hydrogen bonds or participate
comfortably in any regular secondary structure con-
formation. This ensures a relatively rigid separation
of the domains, thereby preventing unfavorable con-
tacts between them.
These linkers are more defined by their ability to reliably predict and maintain end-to-end
distances between attached domains. Such structurally
rigid peptides, often called molecular rulers, have been
conjugated to molecules to serve a metric function.

It is expected in protein modeling that a repeating
oligopeptide with each monomer having the same sta-
ble relationship to its predecessor will generate a
helix. 42 An important physical property of relatively
hard linkers, such as structurally stable helices, is the
ability to reliably predict its end-to-end distances.
Such polypeptides have been termed ‘‘molecular rul-
ers’’ because of their ability to measure the effect of
different depths of binding pockets on various proper-
ties of proteins of interest

Although short stretches of hard linker sequences
are located between functionally relevant regions of
protein structure, mutations within such sequences
may have no effect on the function. 44 Such linkers
are therefore necessary to keep the other amino acid
interactions in register, but the nature of the side
chain is often unimportant. The question that arises is
then, How is the length of the ruler controlled? Many
molecular rulers are made up of repeating molecules
of distinct, rigid monomer units. Because of their
rigidity, predictable changes in length are observed
(up to a limiting point) as additional monomers are
added between functional groups. 43 For instance, in
electron transfer experiments, proline peptides pro-
vide predictable separation distance based on the
number of proline residues.



**********ESTO NO ES NECESARIO ACLARARLO PORQUE EN OTRAS PARTES HABLO DE EJEMPLOS DE LINKERS RIGIDOS NATURALES
The question that often arises is whether the con-
trol of peptide flexibility through molecular rulers is
purely an engineering enterprise or whether function-
ally active molecular rulers are found in nature.
Recently, a naturally functioning molecular ruler was
discovered in bacterial transcription elongation fac-
tors GreA and GreB that promote transcription elon-
gation by stimulating an endogenous, endonucleolytic
transcript cleavage activity of the RNA polymerase.



An independent analysis showed that
Thr, Ser, Gly, and Ala are also preferred residues in
natural linkers. 

Besides, flexible Gly-rich regions
have been observed as natural linkers in proteins,
generating loops that connect domains in multido-
main proteins. 
These glycine-rich peptides confer flexibility,
which allows the specific engineering of hinge regions
into proteins to achieve desired functional motions.
Prediction of the flexibility of a hinge
region is based on an understanding of the rotational
freedom of the attached moieties.

It was discovered that hinge regions are
soft-linker regions of localized torsion angle changes in
the polypeptide chain that allow the attached rigid
domains to pivot. The rotation axes of these torsion
angle changes are nearly parallel to the overall axis of
rotation, so the local motion in the hinges can be
directly related to the overall motion. A crucial feature
of the hinge residues is that they have very few packing
constraints on their main chain atoms.

Hinge regions occur between domains, allowing
them to move independently of one another while
maintaining the individual domains’ three-dimen-
sional shape. 6 In that sense, hinge regions are charac-
terized by a structural softness that enables this
motion.
Early structural biologists observed that
hinge regions may remove steric constraints from the
relative motion of the attached moieties.
Prediction of the softness of a peptide linker is
based on an understanding of the rotational freedom
of the residues involved.

Macromolecular motions encompass hinge bending
as well as other types of molecular flexibility.
frequently occurring natural
polypeptide linkers might be good candidates for
designing soft hinge-type connectors in engineering
applications. Other less frequently observed motions
may be attributed to shear-like gliding at domain inter-
faces and denaturing or irregular folding.









**************************
Un buen analisis de linkers naturales se hace en (ref: An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding)
En donde se dividen los linkers en 2 , segun sus propiedades estructurales (de forma muy general):  helical and non-helical.
Helical linkers are
thought to act as rigid spacers separating two domains.
Non-helical linkers are rich in prolines, which also leads
to structural rigidity and isolation of the linker from
the attached domains. This means that both linker types are likely to act as a scaffold to prevent unfavourable interactions between folding domains.

Both the helical and nonhelical linkers
have similar hydrophobicity. Pro is the most common
terminal linker residue followed by Arg, Phe, Thr,
Glu, and Gln in decreasing order of preference. The
probable reason why proline is favored over other
residues in linking different domains is the inability
of proline to donate hydrogen bonds or participate
comfortably in any regular secondary structure con-
formation. This ensures a relatively rigid separation
of the domains, thereby preventing unfavorable con-
tacts between them.



A partir de esta diversidad en las estructuras y propiedades de las secuencias linkers, 
podría decirse que estas secuencias pueden haber sido seleccionados como parte de la evolución de la proteina, para cumplir una funcion en la proteina, 
probablemente a partir de sus propiedades estructurales.
Recent studies have shown that domain linkers can play
an essential role in maintaining cooperative inter-domain
interactions. 


Inter-domain linkers are likely to
facilitate the folding of multidomain proteins: α-helical linkers
are thought to act as rigid spacers to prevent non-native
interactions between domains that may interfere with correct
domain folding. The requirement for stiffness turns out to be
important also for the non-helical linkers: having a large
proportion of proline residues leads to a rigidity of the
polypeptide. Compared to their helical counterparts, non-
helical linkers have evolved further away from intra-domain
segments, to obtain the required rigidity inherent to the α-
helical conformation.
However, prolines can form tight turns or cis-Pro isomers,
which negatively affect domain independence. The chance of
these conformations can be reduced by careful selection of the
preceding residue, and this study confirms that this happens
in nature.

The observed natural tendency to form rigid linkers might also
be related to avoiding proteolytic cleavage, as linkers are likely
targets for protease degradation

PROPIEDADES DE COMPOSICION, LARGO, ETC. EN LINKERS NATURALES

El primer estudio (creo) que se realizo fue (Argos, 1990) .
Argos carried out a statistical study of natural linkers
with the aim to design independent linkers for gene fusion
that would have a low likelihood of disrupting the folding of
the flanking domains. He constructed a set of 51 linkers from
visual inspection of 32 proteins. The amino acids Thr, Ser,
Pro and Asp were found to be desirable linker constituents.
The author concluded that the preferred linker amino acids are
mostly hydrophilic, often polar and usually small. The majority,
59%, of the linker residues were in coil or bend structures
with a mean length of 6.5 residues, but an average flexibility
when compared to other protein regions. It was suggested that
pentapeptides consisting of only Gly, Ser and Thr would make
the best linkers for gene fusion; as these residues were most
strongly preferred within natural linkers. Differing structures
pointed to the importance of the amino acid order to achieve
an extended and conformationally stable oligopeptide
Este trabajo pointed to the importance of the amino acid order to achieve an extended and conformationally stable oligopeptide.
The analysis by Argos is now slightly outdated since the protein data set used was small and linker delineation had been performed manually.

En el trabajo (\ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding.-George, Heringa), se hace un analisis sobre a much larger data
set, y ademas se desarrolla un metodo automatizado para extraer interdomain linkers from a data set of proteins of known 3D structure. 
Utilizando estos datos, se analizan  the amino acids’ propensities in linkers and examined the preferred order of residues within linkers. 
We have also devised a linker database, which can be used as a starting point to engineer domain fusion.



Mediante mutaciones puntuales o deleciones  sobre una secuencia linker que llevan a reprimir alguna funcionalidad/iteraccion/actividad global de la proteina (Gokhale and Khosla, 2000),
SE DEMUESTRA QUE, NO SOLO LA COMPOSICION SINO TAMBIEN LA LONGITUD DE LA SECUENCIA LINKER SON IMPORTANTES
In general, altering the length of linkers
connecting domains has been shown to affect protein stability,
folding rates and domain–domain orientation

Naturally occurring Gly-rich linkers exist in many
proteins and, aside from linking domains, they are
known to have a functional role in the protein. 
Ejemplos: 

-Crystal structure analysis of the human PAX6 PD-DNA com-
plex revealed that the extended linker makes minor
groove contacts with the DNA. 

-In transmembrane glycoproteins (TMs) of retroviruses, important func-
tional roles are also carried out by the linkers, which
mediate membrane fusion through an N-terminal
fusion peptide. The fusion peptide is linked to the
central coiled-coil core through Gly-rich linkers.






One recent
study showed that a particular flexible linker maintains
its length and flexibility across divergent species despite
having little or no obvious amino acid sequence conser-
vation. Perhaps for this linker, the amino acid composi-
tion is more important than the specific details of the
sequence



the average length of linkers in natural multi-domain proteins was calculated to be
6.5 residues by Argos [23], and 10.0 ± 5.8 residues by George and Heringa (\ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding.
To give insight into the structural environment of the linkers, the average normalized solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity
were also calculated. The data showed higher solvent accessibility with increasing length of
linkers , suggesting that longer linkers were more likely to be exposed to the solvent.
Consistent with these data, the average hydrophobicity of the linkers decreased with the
increase of length, indicating that longer linkers were more hydrophilic and therefore more
exposed in the aqueous solvent than shorter linkers .   ********TODO ESTE ULTIMO PARRAFO SON RESULTADOS DE (\ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding.)






The preference of amino acid residues in natural linkers was also investigated by calculating
the ratio of single amino acid occurrence in the linker and the full protein (Table 1), where
values greater than 1 (shaded) indicate higher occurrences in the linker. By screening the
database, threonine (Thr), serine (Ser), proline (Pro), glycine (Gly), aspartic acid (Asp),
lysine (Lys), glutamine (Gln), asparagine (Asn), and alanine (Ala) were suggested to be
preferable linker constituents by Argos [23], whereas Pro, arginine (Arg), phenylalanine
(Phe), Thr, glutamic acid (Glu) and Gln were preferred in the study by George and Heringa
[24].
Therefore, in general, preferable amino acids were polar uncharged or charged
residues, which constitute approximately 50% of naturally encoded amino acids. Both
studies suggested that Pro, Thr, and Gln were the preferable amino acids for natural linkers.
Among them, Pro is a unique amino acid with a cyclic side chain which causes a very
restricted conformation [25]. The lack of amide hydrogen on Pro may prevent the formation
of hydrogen bonds with other amino acids, and therefore reduces the interaction between the
linkers and the protein domains. As a result, the inclusion of Pro residues might increase the
stiffness and structural independence of the linkers. Many natural multi-domain proteins
contain Pro-rich sequences as interdomain linkers, including the linker between the lipoyl
and E3 binding domain in pyruvate dehydrogenase
The small, polar amino acids, such as Thr (both
studies), or Ser and Gly (Argos’s study), were thought to be favorable because they might
provide good flexibility due to their small sizes, and also help maintain stability of the linker
structure in the aqueous solvent through formation of hydrogen bonds with water.



Overall, natural linkers mainly adopted extended conformations, and had independent
structures that did not interact with the adjacent protein domains. Taken together, their
length, composition, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure were all important to achieve
the desirable functions. The natural linkers could serve as general reference for the rational
design of empirical linkers in recombinant fusion proteins.

****ESTE PARRAFO ESTA EN ref: INTRINSICALLY UNSTRUCTURED PROTEINS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS H. Jane Dyson and Peter E. Wright
A characteristic feature of the linkers
is that they are highly conserved between species in
amino-acid composition, but not in sequence. There is
a high proportion of polar residues (~70%) — a per-
centage that is retained from Caenorhabditis elegans to
Homo sapiens — despite significant differences in
linker length. Examination of individual linkers shows
that they sometimes contain embedded regions that
have a high sequence conservation and an increased
content of charged or hydrophobic residues; some of
these segments map to known interaction or regula-
tory motifs and the others are probable candidates for
such functions.
Linkers of the appropriate length and composition seem to be
essential for the correct assembly of large complexes
Changes in the length or composition of the Pro- and
Gln-repeat regions are thought to be a way of modu-
lating transcriptional activation 105 . The presence of
long linker regions in transcriptional-activator pro-
teins such as CBP/p300 (FIG. 2) facilitates the assembly
of the active transcriptional complex through interac-
tions that occur over a distance scale of hundreds to
thousands of angstroms. For example, a linker that is
400 residues in length — such as the one between the
KIX domain and the bromodomain of CBP/p300 —
has the ability to span distances that range from less than
100 Å to more than 1,500 Å. This gives the transcrip-
tional activator the flexibility to interact with numerous
transcriptional-regulatory factors that are bound with
varying geometries over large promoter/enhancer
regions (hundreds to thousands of base pairs). In
addition, it is easy to envisage that flexible linker
regions would facilitate the recruitment of other pro-
tein factors to the complex, through a mechanism
known as ‘fly-casting’ 106

The functions of linker sequences demand that they
are flexible and extended, and have a relatively high
long-term stability. The low proportion of hydrophobic
residues in linkers might be significant for their func-
tion. Misfolded proteins are targeted for destruction in
the cell, and it is thought that the key to this targeting
is the identification of solvated hydrophobic amino
acids by cellular-destruction mechanisms such as the
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Linker sequences must
necessarily be unfolded, but need to be resistant to pro-
teolysis. It is probable that the lack of hydrophobic
residues in linker sequences is related to the require-
ment of an intrinsically unfolded protein segment for
long-term stability. Furthermore, experimentally, it has
been found that polyglutamine repeats are resistant to
degradation by eukaryotic proteasomes, which is 
consistent with the observed accumulation of such
sequences in POLYGLUTAMINE-REPEAT DISORDERS . The particu-
lar amino-acid composition of linker sequences also
stops them folding to form local structures that might
interact nonspecifically with other proteins.

linker domains (IULD) that tether flanking folded domains.







SOBRE EL ESTUDIO DE LINKERS A FUTURO:

With the rapid
increase of the number of protein structures deposited in the PDB database, an updated study
of natural linkers could be conducted. In addition to the properties analyzed in previous
studies (e.g., amino acid composition, structure classification), it would be interesting to

****************************************

INGENIERIA DE PROTEINAS  /  LINKERS ARTIFICIALES:

As a product of recombinant DNA technology, fusion proteins have been developed as a
class of novel biomolecules with multi-functional properties. By genetically fusing two or
more protein domains together, the fusion protein product may obtain many distinct
functions derived from each of their component moieties.


Recombinant chimeric fusion proteins are routinely
constructed to increase the expression of soluble pro-
teins and to facilitate protein purification. 32,83 Other
engineering approaches that link two proteins or pro-
tein domains by a peptide linker include immunoas-
says (e.g., using chimeras between antibody frag-
ments and proteins 84,85 ), selection and production
of antibodies, 86 and engineering of bifunctional
enzymes. 8

In addition to structural studies of protein–protein
interactions, a wide range of applications in the field
of biotechnology have employed these fused proteins
to explore protein-based biochemistry, such as to cre-
ate artificial bifunctional enzymes, 7 to produce anti-
bodies 8 and proteins with specialized functions, 9 and
as tools for FRET analysis. 10



The successful construction of a recombinant fusion protein requires two indispensable
elements: the component proteins and the linkers. The choice of the component proteins is
based on the desired functions of the fusion protein product and, in most cases, is relatively
straightforward. On the other hand, the selection of a suitable linker to join the protein
domains together can be complicated and is often neglected in the design of fusion proteins.
Direct fusion of functional domains without a linker may lead to many undesirable
outcomes, including misfolding of the fusion proteins [17], low yield in protein production
[18], or impaired bioactivity [19, 20]. Therefore, the selection or rational design of a linker
to join fusion protein domains is an important, yet underexplored, area in recombinant
fusion protein technology.







ASPECTOS FUNCIONALES DE LOS LINKERS EN LA INGENIERIA DE PROTEINAS:
En (\ref Fusion Protein Linkers: Property, Design and Functionality - Xiaoying Chen)  se desarrollan varias funcionalidades que pueden cumplir los linkers, aca va un resumen de eso:

Besides the basic role in linking the functional domains together (as
in flexible and rigid linkers) or releasing free functional domain in vivo (as in in vivo cleavable
linkers), linkers may offer many other advantages for the production of fusion proteins, such as
improving biological activity, increasing expression yield, and achieving desirable
pharmacokinetic profiles.
The most basic function of linkers in recombinant fusion proteins is to covalently join the
functional domains (e.g. flexible linkers or rigid linkers) or to release them under desired
conditions (cleavable linkers). Linkers can also provide many derived functions in protein
drug design such as improving biological activities, increasing production, achieving a
controlled or targeted drug delivery, as well as achieving desirable PK profiles of the fusion
proteins (Tables 1 and 2).


**********puedo resumir todas las funcionalidades en un mismo parrafito


-Linkers can improve folding and stability of fusion proteins ***ESTE LO PUEDO OBVIAR, ESTA BASTANTE BIEN EXPLICADO EN EL SIGUIENTE, COMO ES QUE AYUDA AL PLEGAMIENTO

-Linkers can improve expression of fusion proteins: Besides impaired biological activity, the difficulty to express stable and high levels of
recombinant fusion protein is often another hurdle during the application of fusion proteins
for drug delivery. Due to the structural perturbation between protein domains, fusion
proteins may be misfolded, unstable and appear as a heterogeneous product [17, 20], often
resulting in a low expression yield. Although the expression of fusion proteins can
sometimes be improved by simply switching the orientation of the component protein
domains [53], the interference may not be effectively reduced due to the short distance
between domains. Since many linkers can keep domains at proper distance and allow for
their independent folding, they can serve as practical tools to enhance the expression yield of
recombinant fusion proteins.

The exact mechanism for the ability of the helical linker
to improve expression of fusion proteins is still not very clear. The rigid, extended structure
of the helical linker may effectively separate the functional domains and greatly reduce their
interference. As a result, the fusion protein may be able to fold properly and obtain enhanced
stability within the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in an increased expression level. With
further studies, more linkers may be identified for enhancing protein expression.


-Linkers can improve bioactivity of fusion proteins: By fusing two or more protein domains, a fusion protein usually obtains the biological
activities from each component. However, the direct fusion of proteins often results in
impaired biological activity [20, 54, 55], probably because the functional domains are
brought too close to properly interact with their corresponding binding proteins (i.e.
receptors or ligands). Under these circumstances, linkers may be very effective tools to
provide appropriate distance between domains to reduce their interference, restore or
improve folding, or allow for the in vivo release of the free protein drug domain to
ultimately improve bioactivity

-Linkers can target fusion proteins to specific sites in vivo: Linker insertion between fusion protein domains can also improve or enable targeting of
fusion protein to specific sites in vivo. One way in which linkers can improve targeting is
simply by increasing the binding affinity of the targeting protein domain for its receptor.
This concept is very similar what has already been discussed in Section 5.3, where linkers
can provide distance between domains, reduce their interference, and ultimately improve
their receptor binding affinity. A second approach for application of linkers to improve drug
targeting involves introduction of a linker sequence that will enable specific activation of the
fusion protein at the target site. In this approach, the intact fusion protein shows reduced or a
lack of biological activity, but the cleavage of the linker at specific sites releases the free,
biologically active protein drug domain at the target site


-Linkers can affect the PK(pharmacokinetics) of fusion proteins
Fusion proteins obtain many advantages over the parent proteins, such as improved PK(pharmacokinetics) and
PD(pharmacodynamics) properties as in albumin- and Fc-fusion proteins, as well as the drug targeting effects as
in immunotoxins.





DISEÑO/OBTENCION DE LINKERS:

Despite many empirical surveys,
very little is known about the structural factors that
govern interdomain flexibility. Such lack of knowledge
is a limiting factor in de novo chimera design. There-
fore, a number of recent studies focused on the struc-
tural principles governing the domain architecture and
their assembly. 98–107 The emerging concepts, along
with the bioinformatics tools that attempt to detect
domains and their motions from sequence information
alone, 108 may one day lead to a precise de novo engi-
neering of interdomain flexibility, thereby helping
achieve the desired functioning of synthetic chimeras.



The studies of linkers in natural multi-domain proteins have generated many candidates for the general purpose of protein fusion
In addition, researchers have designed many
empirical linkers with various sequences and conformations for the construction of
recombinant fusion proteins.

The study of linker composition and structure, and the investigation of linker function
should go hand in hand when designing a novel linker.

Design of multifunctional chimeric protein analogs that are synthesized using modern molecular biology techniques has been possible because of development of diverse biophysical and computational techniques to detect and quantitatively characterize the geometric properties of domains and their linkers. 
Often, dynamic domains and entire proteins are fused together by specific linker peptides. These chimera proteins facilitate the study of protein folding, allow the crystallographic characterization of noncrystallizing components, and enable the labeling and tracking of proteins in optical microscopy. We give a comprehensive overview of such state-of-theart technologies


Although many examples
of various types of linkers have been developed in the past, the rational design of linkers for
the construction of fusion proteins is still in its infancy.


Se han usado linkers ricos en gly o secuencias poli-Gly. 
Este tipo de polipeptidos do not affect the function of the individual proteins to which they attach. 
The fused proteins behave independently, such that the
single chained proteins can perform the combined
function of fused partner

In other systems, however, linker regions can affect the stability, solu-
bility, oligomeric state, and proteolytic resistance of
the fused proteins

Thus, it is important that the
length and amino acid composition of a potential
linker is optimized in order to preserve the biological
activity of the individual proteins in the fused
complex.

The loop length created by the linker can have a
profound effect on the action of the linker in the
fused complex




Diseño de molecular rulers (linkers rigidos): The major concern in the design of a molecular
ruler is the possibility of softening and structural fail-
ure that arises when the ruler is unable to provide a
predictable separation distance between its bound
moieties. An adequate cushion distance is often
required when designing the linkers.


Linker engineering, with the aim to control the
distance, orientation, and relative motion of two func-
tional domains, will increase in importance with
increasing emphasis on the de novo design of multi-
domain proteins. A number of recent databases and
surveys aid in the design of linkers for chimeric pro-
teins.(ref. An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding)



********ESTO QUE SIGUE ES DE (\ref Fusion Protein Linkers: Property, Design and Functionality - Xiaoying Chen) 
The general properties of linkers derived from naturally-occurring multi-domain proteins can be
considered as the foundation in linker design. Empirical linkers designed by researchers are
generally classified into 3 categories according to their structures: flexible linkers, rigid linkers,
and in vivo cleavable linkers. 
three types of empirical linkers (flexible linkers, rigid linkers, and cleavable linkers) will be discussed to illustrate their versatile applications for fusion protein construction


FLEXIBLE LINKERS****************
Flexible linkers are usually applied when the joined domains require a certain degree of
movement or interaction. They are generally composed of small, non-polar (e.g. Gly) or
polar (e.g. Ser or Thr) amino acids as suggested by Argos [23]. The small size of these
amino acids provides flexibility, and allows for mobility of the connecting functional
domains. The incorporation of Ser or Thr can maintain the stability of the linker in aqueous
solutions by forming hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, and therefore reduces the
unfavorable interaction between the linker and the protein moieties.
The most commonly used flexible linkers have sequences consisting primarily of stretches
of Gly and Ser residues (“GS” linker). An example of the most widely used flexible linker
has the sequence of (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) n . By adjusting the copy number “n”, the length
of this GS linker can be optimized to achieve appropriate separation of the functional
domains, or to maintain necessary inter-domain interactions. Besides the GS linkers, many
other flexible linkers have been designed for recombinant fusion proteins. As suggested by
Argos [23], these flexible linkers are also rich in small or polar amino acids such as Gly and
Ser, but can contain additional amino acids such as Thr and Ala to maintain flexibility, as
well as polar amino acids such as Lys and Glu to improve solubility.

In summary, flexible linkers are generally rich in small or polar amino acids such as Gly and
Ser to provide good flexibility and solubility. They are suitable choices when certain
movements or interactions (e.g. scFv) are required for fusion protein domains. In addition,
although flexible linkers do not have rigid structures, they can serve as a passive linker to
keep a distance between functional domains. The length of the flexible linkers can be
adjusted to allow for proper folding or to achieve optimal biological activity of the fusion
proteins.

RIGID LINKERS **********************************

While flexible linkers have the advantage to connect the functional domains passively and
permitting certain degree of movements, the lack of rigidity of these linkers can be a
limitation. There are several examples in the literature where the use of flexible linkers
resulted in poor expression yields or loss of biological activity.
The ineffectiveness of flexible linkers in these
instances was attributed to an inefficient separation of the protein domains or insufficient
reduction of their interference with each other. Under these situations, rigid linkers have
been successfully applied to keep a fixed distance between the domains and to maintain their
independent functions

Alpha helix-forming linkers with the sequence of (EAAAK) n have been applied to the
construction of many recombinant fusion proteins [18, 20]. As suggested by George and
Heringa [24], many natural linkers exhibited α-helical structures. The α-helical structure
was rigid and stable, with intra-segment hydrogen bonds and a closely packed backbone
[28]. Therefore, the stiff α-helical linkers may act as rigid spacers between protein domains.

Un ejemplo interesante, relacionado con la aplicacion que motivó este trabajo(FRET) se puede ver en (\ref Design of the linkers which effectively separate domains of a bifunctional fusion protein - Ryoichi Arai,): En este trabajo.....
An empirical rigid linker with the sequence of A(EAAAK) n A (n = 2-5) was first designed.
The linker displayed α-helical conformation, which was stabilized by
the Glu − -Lys + salt bridges within segments. To test whether they could effectively separate
the protein domains, these helical linkers were inserted between enhanced blue fluorescent
protein (EBFP) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and the fluorescent
resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between EBFP and EGFP was measured [34].
The FRET efficiency decreased as the length of helical peptides increased, indicating that
helical linkers can control the distance between domains by changing repetitions of the
EAAAK motif. Compared to flexible linkers with the same length, the helical linkers
induced much less FRET efficiency when inserted into EBFP-EGFP fusion proteins,
suggesting that helical linkers can separate functional domains more effectively.

Another type of rigid linkers has a Pro-rich sequence, (XP) n , with X designating any amino
acid, preferably Ala, Lys, or Glu. As suggested by George and Heringa [24], the presence of
Pro in non-helical linkers can increase the stiffness, and allows for effective separation of
the protein domains. The structure of proline-rich sequences was extensively investigated by
several groups

In conclusion, rigid linkers exhibit relatively stiff structures by adopting α-helical structures
or by containing multiple Pro residues. Under many circumstances, they separate the
functional domains more efficiently than the flexible linkers. The length of the linkers can
be easily adjusted by changing the copy number to achieve an optimal distance between
domains. As a result, rigid linkers are chosen when the spatial separation of the domains is
critical to preserve the stability or bioactivity of the fusion proteins.




In Vivo CLEAVABLE LINKERS *****************************
The linkers discussed so far generally consist of stable peptide sequences that will not be
preferentially cleaved in vivo . These stable linkers covalently join functional domains
together to act as one molecule throughout the in vivo processes. The stable linkage between
functional domains provides many advantages such as a prolonged plasma half-life (e.g.
albumin or Fc-fusions). However, it also has several potential drawbacks including steric
hindrance between functional domains, decreased bioactivity, and altered biodistribution and
metabolism of the protein moieties due to the interference between domains [19, 39, 40].
Under these circumstances, cleavable linkers are introduced to release free functional
domains in vivo . The design of in vivo cleavable linker in recombinant fusion proteins is
quite challenging. Unlike the versatility of crosslinking agents available for chemical
conjugation methods, linkers in recombinant fusion proteins are required to be
oligopeptides. The linkers introduced in this section take advantage of the unique in vivo
processes, and are cleaved under specific conditions such as the presence of reducing
reagents or proteases. This type of linker may reduce steric hindrance, improve bioactivity,
or achieve independent actions/metabolism of individual domains of recombinant fusion
proteins after linker cleavage

Besides the reduction of disulfide bond, the in vivo cleavage of the linkers in recombinant
fusion proteins may also be carried out by proteases that are expressed in vivo under
pathological conditions (e.g. cancer or inflammation), in specific cells or tissues, or
constrained within certain cellular compartments (Figure 2). Such in vivo cleavable linkers
are designed to be liable to a particular protease by incorporating specific protease-sensitive
sequences. Unlike the reduction of disulfide bond which happens rapidly in the blood
circulation [39], the specificity of many proteases offers slower cleavage of the linker at
constrained compartments. As will be further discussed in Section 5.4, this type of cleavable
linker can therefore be applied to target activation of fusion protein bioactivity at specific
sites in vivo .




RESUMEN**************************
In summary, linkers can adopt various structures and exert diverse functions to fulfill the
application of fusion proteins (Table 2). The flexible linkers are often rich in small or
hydrophilic amino acids such as Gly or Ser to provide the structural flexibility and have
been applied to connect functional domains that favor interdomain interactions or
movements. In cases where sufficient separation of protein domains is required, rigid linkers
may be preferable. By adopting α-helical structures or incorporating Pro, the rigid linkers
can efficiently keep protein moieties at a distance. Both flexible and rigid linkers are stable
in vivo, and do not allow the separation of joined proteins. Cleavable linkers, on the other
hand, permit the release of free functional domain in vivo via reduction or proteolytic
cleavage. They can be utilized to improve the bioactivity of chimeric proteins, or to
specifically deliver prodrugs to target sites where the linkers are processed to activate
bioactivity. The rational choice of linkers should be based on the properties of the linkers
and the desired fusion proteins.





RECURSOS DISPONIBLES PARA DISEÑO DE LINKERS


Como se dice en (\ref Fusion Protein Linkers: Property, Design and Functionality - Xiaoying Chen) 
The extensive studies about linkers in natural multi-domain proteins and recombinant fusion
proteins fostered the idea of building databases and coming up with linker designing tools to
aid the rational design of linkers based on the desired characteristics of fusion proteins.

Es decir, actualmente la metodologia esta centrada en crear bases de datos de linkers y hacer consultas sobre esta en base a las propiedades que se buscan.

An example of this type of tool is a program called LINKER, which searches its database of
linker sequences with user-specified inputs (e.g., linker length, protease sensitive sequences
to be avoided), and generates an output of several linker sequences that fit the criteria.

The search algorithm accepts several query types (eg, PDB code, PDB header, linker
length, C-alpha extent, solvent accessibility, secondary structure or sequence). The program
can provide the linkers sequences meeting the searching criteria, and also provide other
information such as the PDB code and a brief description of the source protein, linker’s
position within the source protein, linker length, solvent accessibility, and secondary
structure. Users can search for sequences with desired properties, and obtain candidate
sequences from natural multi-domain proteins.



A pesar que las BBDD no suelen ser la solucion total al problema, building an empirical
linker database could help summarize the knowledge and facilitate the future linker design.
The extensive studies on the structures of empirical linkers have provided us with useful
information for optimal linker design. Ultimately, more searching algorithms for linker
databases could be developed, and provide more linker candidates for protein fusion based
on user specifications.
Lo bueno de las BBDD es que los elementos que contienen suelen haber sido probados experimentalmente, lo cual es fundamental.
