LINKERS NATURALES:

Los linkers naturales son secuencias que actuan como espaciadores entre los dominios de una proteina.
Esto solo se puede decir acerca de su definicion.

Los estudios sobre secuencias linkers se comenzaron a hacer a partir del analisis estadistico de secuencias que podian ser clasificadas como linkers a partir de estructuras/secuencias almacenadas en bases de datos de prototeinas.
A lo largo de los años los conocimientos sobre la composición y propiedades de estas secuencias ha ido cambiando, 
a medida que mayor cantidad de estructuras se resolvian y mayor conocimiento se obtenia acerca de los dominios que componen las proteinas(ademas tambien influyeron otras cosas como tecnicas de biofisica para obtener informacion estructural en solucion, o algoritmos para automatizar la identificacion de la secuencia que actua como linker en una proteina)

A partir de estudios de las secuencias linkers naturales se ha encontrado que:
Proline is common to many naturally derived interdomain
linkers, and structural studies indicate that proline-
rich sequences form relatively rigid extended struc-
tures to prevent unfavorable interactions between
the domains.  
The probable reason why proline is favored over other
residues in linking different domains is the inability
of proline to donate hydrogen bonds or participate
comfortably in any regular secondary structure con-
formation. This ensures a relatively rigid separation
of the domains, thereby preventing unfavorable con-
tacts between them.
These linkers are more defined by their ability to reliably predict and maintain end-to-end
distances between attached domains. Such structurally
rigid peptides, often called molecular rulers, have been
conjugated to molecules to serve a metric function.

An independent analysis showed that
Thr, Ser, Gly, and Ala are also preferred residues in
natural linkers. 

Besides, flexible Gly-rich regions
have been observed as natural linkers in proteins,
generating loops that connect domains in multido-
main proteins. 
These glycine-rich peptides confer flexibility,
which allows the specific engineering of hinge regions
into proteins to achieve desired functional motions.


En otra clasificacion(ref: An analysis of protein domain linkers: their classification and role in protein folding)
Two main types of linker were identified; helical and non-helical. Helical linkers are
thought to act as rigid spacers separating two domains.
Non-helical linkers are rich in prolines, which also leads to structural rigidity and isolation of the linker from
the attached domains. This means that both linker types are likely to act as a scaffold to prevent unfavourable interactions between folding domains.


A partir de esta diversidad en las estructuras y propiedades de las secuencias linkers, 
podría decirse que estas secuencias pueden haber sido seleccionados como parte de la evolución de la proteina, para cumplir una funcion en la proteina, 
probablemente a partir de sus propiedades estructurales.
Recent studies have shown that domain linkers can play
an essential role in maintaining cooperative inter-domain
interactions. 

Inter-domain linkers are likely to
facilitate the folding of multidomain proteins: α-helical linkers
are thought to act as rigid spacers to prevent non-native
interactions between domains that may interfere with correct
domain folding. The requirement for stiffness turns out to be
important also for the non-helical linkers: having a large
proportion of proline residues leads to a rigidity of the
polypeptide. Compared to their helical counterparts, non-
helical linkers have evolved further away from intra-domain
segments, to obtain the required rigidity inherent to the α-
helical conformation.
However, prolines can form tight turns or cis-Pro isomers,
which negatively affect domain independence. The chance of
these conformations can be reduced by careful selection of the
preceding residue, and this study confirms that this happens
in nature.

The observed natural tendency to form rigid linkers might also
be related to avoiding proteolytic cleavage, as linkers are likely
targets for protease degradation


Mediante mutaciones puntuales o deleciones  sobre una secuencia linker que llevan a reprimir alguna funcionalidad/iteraccion/actividad global de la proteina (Gokhale and Khosla, 2000),
SE DEMUESTRA QUE, NO SOLO LA COMPOSICION SINO TAMBIEN LA LONGITUD DE LA SECUENCIA LINKER SON IMPORTANTES
In general, altering the length of linkers
connecting domains has been shown to affect protein stability,
folding rates and domain–domain orientation

Naturally occurring Gly-rich linkers exist in many
proteins and, aside from linking domains, they are
known to have a functional role in the protein. 
Ejemplos: 

-Crystal structure analysis of the human PAX6 PD-DNA com-
plex revealed that the extended linker makes minor
groove contacts with the DNA. 

-In transmembrane glycoproteins (TMs) of retroviruses, important func-
tional roles are also carried out by the linkers, which
mediate membrane fusion through an N-terminal
fusion peptide. The fusion peptide is linked to the
central coiled-coil core through Gly-rich linkers.

INGENIERIA DE PROTEINAS  /  LINKERS ARTIFICIALES:



Recombinant chimeric fusion proteins are routinely
constructed to increase the expression of soluble pro-
teins and to facilitate protein purification. 32,83 Other
engineering approaches that link two proteins or pro-
tein domains by a peptide linker include immunoas-
says (e.g., using chimeras between antibody frag-
ments and proteins 84,85 ), selection and production
of antibodies, 86 and engineering of bifunctional
enzymes. 8

In addition to structural studies of protein–protein
interactions, a wide range of applications in the field
of biotechnology have employed these fused proteins
to explore protein-based biochemistry, such as to cre-
ate artificial bifunctional enzymes, 7 to produce anti-
bodies 8 and proteins with specialized functions, 9 and
as tools for FRET analysis. 10






/ RECURSOS ACTUALES 

Actualmente se han usado linkers ricos en gly o secuencias poli-Gly. 
Este tipo de polipeptidos do not affect the function of the individual proteins to which they attach. 
The fused proteins behave independently, such that the
single chained proteins can perform the combined
function of fused partner
 
In other systems, however, linker regions can affect the stability, solu-
bility, oligomeric state, and proteolytic resistance of
the fused proteins

Thus, it is important that the
length and amino acid composition of a potential
linker is optimized in order to preserve the biological
activity of the individual proteins in the fused
complex.

The loop length created by the linker can have a
profound effect on the action of the linker in the
fused complex


Linker engineering, with the aim to control the
distance, orientation, and relative motion of two func-
tional domains, will increase in importance with
increasing emphasis on the de novo design of multi-
domain proteins.

DOMINIOS 

Many cellular processes involve proteins with multiple
domains. The modular nature of proteins has many advantages,
providing increased stability and new cooperative functions.
Other advantages include the protection of intermediates within
inter-domain clefts that may otherwise be unstable in aqueous
environments and the fixed stoichiometric ratio of enzymatic
activity necessary for a sequential set of reactions


Protein domains can be defined as segmented por-
tions of a polypeptide sequence that assume stable
three-dimensional structure. 6 Such recurring protein
motifs are significant because it is increasingly recog-
nized that there are only a limited number of domain
families in nature.

Although a consensus in detail is still lacking, various
effective criteria have been proposed to detect and
define protein domains. These criteria rely mainly on
the existence of local structural compactness arising
from beta-sheets or hydrophobic cores. 11,12 Based on
such compactness, computational algorithms to detect
structural domains have been proposed


Hinge regions occur between domains, allowing
them to move independently of one another while
maintaining the individual domains’ three-dimen-
sional shape. 6 In that sense, hinge regions are charac-
terized by a structural softness that enables this
motion.
