Durante la última década, uno de los mayores cambios en el campo
de las proteínas ha sido el reconocimiento de la ubicuidad e importancia de las proteínas
intrínsecamente desordenadas. Un reflejo de estas investigaciones puede encontrarse en bases de
datos específicas (18) y aplicaciones bioinformáticas capaces de identificar el desorden intrínseco (19).
Dichas secuencias presentan en solución un conjunto heterogéneo de conformaciones fácilmente
maleable por cambios en el medio. En lugar del análisis estructural clásico basado en dominios
globulares, podemos describir estos conjuntos conformacionales en términos de los promedios y
desviaciones estándar de la distancia entre los extremos de la secuencia, el radio hidrodinámico, el
contenido en estructura secundaria y otros parámetros (20).


En los ultimos años se han encontrado gran cantidad de proteinas que adoptan cuyas estructuras son total o parcialmente desordenadas(segmentos globulares). 
El estudio de estas proteinas llevo a encontrar una gran cantidad de funcionalidades asociadas, .... 
The physical characteristics of IDPs allow an exqui‐
site level of control of cellular signalling processes. Their
favourable characteristics include: the presence of small
recognition elements that fold on partner binding; a
degree of flexibility, which enables them to interact
promiscuously with different targets on different occa‐
sions; accessible sites for post-translational modificatio­n;
e­fficient utilization of conserved sequence motifs to
mediate binding interactions; the ability to bind part‐
ners with high specificity but modest affinity, leading to rapid and spontaneous dissociation and termination of
the signal 1,3,19 ; kinetic advantages in signalling 20 , as their
extremely fast association rates allow signals to be rap‐
idly turned on.


Al diseñar una secuencia con estas propiedades estructurales, y que queremos que sea a la vez inerte, se deberán chequear todas estas diversas funcionalidades de la mejor manera posible.



From a wide range of in vitro experiments on
peptides and proteins we now know that the formation of
amyloid structures is not a rare phenomenon associated
with a small number of diseases but rather that it reflects a
well-defined structural form of the protein that is an alter-
native to the native state — a form that may in principle be
adopted by many, if not all, polypeptide sequences


The multiplicity of protein states:
In addition to their functional native structures, protein­s
also populate various other states, including disordered
and partially ordered conformations, and different
aggregate­d assemblies

Although it was
evident from early studies that both soluble and fibril-
lar forms of proteins could exist 33 , most attention was
focused on the soluble states that were found to possess
demonstrable biological function.


A combination of experimental and
theoretical studies has clarified how given sequences
define specific free energy surfaces that enable folding 38–40 .
This problem is, however, challenging, as a free energy
surface depends on a very large number of relatively
weak interactions, including hydrogen bonds, electro­
static interactions, dispersion forces and interactions with
solvent molecules that underlie the hydrophobic effect.
Moreover, as we discuss below, in some cases the native
state of a given peptide or protein may not be structured
in a globular form but disordered. Regardless of its nature,
however, the functional native state is likely to only reflect
a local free energy minimum at physiological concentra-
tions, as self-association into aggregated protein spe-
cies may in many cases lower the global free energy 41,42
(BOX 1) . Indeed, the maintenance of protein solubility has
emerged as a central aspect of the more general topic of
protein homeostasis 3,43,44 .




Intrinsically disordered pro-
teins are not, however, necessarily prone to aggregation, as
their sequences have usually evolved to maintain the level
of solubility that is required for their optimal function;
for example, through the existence of extensive regions
that are highly abundant in charged and polar groups
that disfavour intermolecular association from a thermo­
dynamic point of view. 
Moreover, as is discussed below,
kinetic barriers to aggregation are crucial in enabling both
globular and disordered proteins to maintain their soluble
and functional states


Many proteins adopt various other biologically rel-
evant conformational states in addition to their native
structure.  These
partially folded protein species are particularly vulner-
able to misfolding and aggregation from which they must
be protected in living systems


Although most common forms of proteins are
soluble, some functional states are insoluble,
for example the fibrillar assemblies that form the cellular
cytoskeleton. Proteins are also, however,
vulnerable to forming a wide variety of non-functional
aggregated species. Indeed, proteins exhibit generic poly­
meric and colloidal patterns of behaviour.
Aggregated forms of proteins can be generally amorphous on an ultra­structural
level. Of particular fascination, however, because of their
remarkable structures and properties, are highly ordered
self-associated species of peptides and proteins, notably
amyloid fibrils and closely related prion-like states.

it has been found that the proteinaceous
deposits extracted from tissues in misfolding diseases
typically have amyloid characteristics.
Remarkably, there is no evident similarity in
the sequences, native structures or functions of the group
of disease-associated proteins.


Normally soluble proteins or peptides convert under
certain conditions into ordered fibrillar aggregates
known as amyloid deposits.

Several observations (por ejemplo que ordinary peptides and proteins can convert
under appropriate laboratory conditions into aggregates with all the characteristics of the amyloid fibrils),
, together with a wide variety of biophysical and computational
studies, led to the suggestion that the amyloid structure
can in principle be adopted by any polypeptide chain.


******* The amyloid state of a protein is therefore generic,
as it is accessible to many different polypeptide chains,
and, unlike the native state, its essential architecture is
not encoded by the amino acid sequence 1,26 , although
the details of its structure and stability can be markedly
sequence-dependent, as we discuss below. ********************


Similar to globular
native states, amyloid structures are closely packed and
highly ordered






****************************************
The healthy state of a cell is characterized by a detailed
balance between the different states that proteins can
populate. Perturbations to such balance, unless they are
kept under strict control, can lead to deleterious events
and disease.

PAPER: Understanding Protein Non-Folding
***********************************
***********************************


From the 1980s onwards, a number of researchers pointed out that lack of structure or flexibility
can be important for biological function.

some of the ID proteins have been discovered due their unusual amino acid sequence compositions and the absence of
regular structure in these proteins has been explained by the specific features of their amino
acid sequences including the presence of numerous uncompensated charged groups (often
negative); i.e., a high net charge at neutral pH, arising from the extreme pI values in such
proteins , and a low content of hydrophobic amino acid residues.
it has been concluded that the combination of low mean hydrophobicity and
relatively high net charge represents an important prerequisite for the absence of compact
structure in proteins under physiological conditions. 
This observation was used to develop a charge-hydropathy (CH) plot method of analysis
that distinguishes ordered and disordered proteins based only on their net charges and
hydropathies.
rom the physical viewpoint, such a combination of low hydrophobicity with high net charge
as a prerequisite for intrinsic unfoldedness makes perfect sense: high net charge leads to charge-
charge repulsion, and low hydrophobicity means less driving force for protein compaction. In
other words, these features are characteristic for ID proteins with the coil-like (or close to coil-
like) structures.
the disordered proteins are significantly depleted in bulky
hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, and Val) and aromatic amino acid residues (Trp, Tyr, and Phe), which
would normally form the hydrophobic core of a folded globular protein, and also possess low
content of Cys and Asn residues.
The depletion of ID protein in Cys is also crucial as this amino
acid residue is known to have a significant contribution to the protein conformation stability
via the disulfide bond formation or being involved in coordination of different prosthetic
groups.
On the other hand, ID proteins were shown to be substantially
enriched in polar, disorder-promoting, amino acids: Ala, Arg, Gly, Gln, Ser, Glu, and Lys and
also in the hydrophobic, but structure braking Pro.

In addition to amino-acid composition, the disordered segments have also been compared with
the ordered ones by various attributes such as hydropathy, net charge, flexibility index, helix
propensities, strand propensities, and compositions for groups of amino acids such as W + Y
+ F (aromaticity).

Thus, the ID proteins differ dramatically from the ordered proteins in their amino acid
sequences. These differences were used to develop different predictors of intrinsic disorder.

ID proteins have dynamic structures that interconvert on a number of timescales and have been
shown to have many similarities to non-native states of “normal” globular proteins, which may
exist in at least four different conformations: native (ordered), molten globule, pre-molten
globule, and coil-like.
Using this analogy, it has been established that ID proteins
and regions under physiological conditions in vitro might contain collapsed-disorder (i.e.,
where ID is present in a form of molten globules) and extended-disorder (i.e., regions where
ID is present in a form of random coil or pre-molten globule)


****Collapsed disorder********  The structural properties of the molten globule (which was
originally described as universal folding intermediate of globular proteins) are well known and
have been systematized in number of reviews (e.g., see [38] and references therein). The protein
molecule in this intermediate state has no (or has only a trace of) rigid cooperatively melted
tertiary structure. However, it is characterized not only by the well-developed secondary
structure, but also by the presence of some topology, i.e., relatively fixed mutual positioning
of the secondary structure elements [124-131]. A considerable increase in the accessibility of
a protein molecule to proteases was noted as a specific property of the molten globule
[132-136]. The transformation into this intermediate state is accompanied by a considerable
increase in the affinity of a protein molecule to the hydrophobic fluorescence probes


****** Extended disorder***  A significant number of sequences encodes for the extendedly
disordered proteins that are characterized by low sequence complexity. Are these proteins
random coils, or do they possess residual or transient structure? If they have residual or transient
structure, how should they be classified? Based on the analysis of the available literature, it
has been concluded that such proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected
for members of a single thermodynamic entity. In fact, they may be divided into two structurally
different groups, intrinsic coils and intrinsic pre-molten globules

The unfolded protein is essentially never a true random coil. In fact, the existence of significant
residual structure in the unfolded globular protein has been described even under the most
severe denaturing conditions, such as high concentrations of strong denaturants [144-147].
Thus, coil-like ID proteins are not completely random, but are characterized by the presence
of some residual (and highly flexible) structure. This fact is very important for the functioning
of these proteins.

PAPER: Adapting Proteostasis for Disease Intervention
***********************************
***********************************

The protein components of eukaryotic cells face acute and chronic challenges to their integrity.
Eukaryotic protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, enables healthy cell and organismal development
and aging and protects against disease

Proteostasis refers to controlling the con-
centration, conformation, binding interac-
tions (quaternary structure), and location
of individual proteins making up the proteome
by readapting the innate biology of the cell, often
through transcriptional and translational changes
