Waltz allows users to identify and better distinguish between amyloid sequences and amorphous ÓÅ¢-sheet aggregates and allowed us to identify
amyloid-forming regions in functional amyloids.

To better understand the sequence determinants of amyloid
structure, we explored the sequence diversity of amyloid hexa-
peptides by inspecting more than 200 peptides using various
structural and biophysical methods.
Our analysis highlighted the strong
position-specific tendencies of the different amino acids for form-
ing amyloid structures observed both in disease-related as well as
in functional amyloids.
