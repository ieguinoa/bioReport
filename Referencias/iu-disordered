MECANISMOS FUNCIONALES:




On a more structural basis, the related
concepts of preformed structural elements (PSEs [41]) and
molecular recognition features (MoRFs [42]) are suggested
to be short disordered regions that sample structured
states within the conformational ensemble, and become
fully ordered upon binding to the partner.
Binding by
motifs is usually weak, transient, and possibly of limited
specificity [39], which can be made stronger and/or more
specific by either cooperating with flanking regions, com-
bining several motifs, or utilizing longer disordered
domains (VER ref:Close encounters of the third kind: disordered
domains and the interactions of proteins,
 en este paper se habla de 'disordered domains' como un tipo distinto a los short recognition motifs)

************DICHO DE OTRA FORMA
Binding of IDPs to their partners via linear motifs is often
weak and is of limited specificity [11]. When stronger,
more specific binding is required, IDPs use two distinct
strategies. For one, they may use disordered domains for
recognition [23], which are longer than 20 residues and
conform to all three domain definitions, that is they are
autonomous structural, functional, and evolutionary units.
These long disordered regions (Figure 2) should be
recognized as novel structural–functional elements of
IDPs [23]. The other strategy is the combined action
of several motifs,











IDPs EN FUNCIONES DE INTERACCION
When IUPs/IDRs are involved in PPIs,
they undergo induced folding or disorder-to-order
transition, 18,19 suggested to provide several advan-
tages, such as specificity without excessive binding
strength, increased speed of interaction, binding
promiscuity or moonlighting, among others. 14,20,21
These advantages underscore the high frequency of
disorder in proteins organizing the interactome, i.e.
in hubs. 22–25 In terms of the molecular details of the
recognition process, it has been suggested that IUPs
often use short sequential recognition elements for
binding, termed primary contact sites, 26 preformed
structural elements, 27 or molecular recognition
elements/features (MorEs/MorFs). 28,29 In direct
connection with these concepts, a recent analysis
has shown that short linear motifs in proteins often
fall into locally disordered regions, 30 underlying
the suggestion that interactions of IUPs/IDRs 
We found that the chemical and physical
features of interfaces of IUPs are distinct from those
of globular proteins in many aspects, such as a much
larger relative area, and preference for hydrophobic
residues, which exceeds even the interior of the
protein. Their much larger contact number per
residue are indicative of structural adaptation
driven by induced folding, and suggest that IUPs
might preferentially gain stabilization energy from
contacts with the partner.
The detailed analysis of the amino acid composi-
tion of the interfaces provides full evidence for this
point, i.e. that IUPs preserve and expose their
hydrophobic residues for partner binding. In agree-
ment with previous studies, 5,32 the analysis of
ordered proteins shows that their surface is enriched
in polar/charged residues, and depleted in hydro-
phobic residues
The characteristic differences found between the two types of complexes
suggest that IUPs represent a distinct molecular implementation of the
principles of protein–protein recognition. The interfaces do not differ in size,
but those of IUPs cover a much larger part of the surface of the protein than
for their ordered counterparts. Moreover, IUP interfaces are significantly
more hydrophobic relative to their overall amino acid composition, but also
in absolute terms. They rely more on hydrophobic–hydrophobic than on
polar–polar interactions. Their amino acids in the interface realize more
intermolecular contacts, which suggests a better fit with the partner due to
induced folding upon binding that results in a better adaptation to the
partner. The two modes of interaction also differ in that IUPs usually use
only a single continuous segment for partner binding, whereas the binding
sites of ordered proteins are more segmented. Probably, all these features
contribute to the increased evolutionary conservation of IUP interface
residues. These noted molecular differences are also manifested in the
interaction energies of IUPs.




FUNCIONALIDADES:

El estudio de estas proteinas llevo a encontrar una gran cantidad de funcionalidades asociadas.The physical characteristics of IDPs allow an exquisite level of control of cellular signalling processes. Their favourable characteristics include: the presence of small recognition elements that fold on partner binding; a degree of flexibility, which enables them to interact promiscuously with different targets on different occasions; accessible sites for post-translational modificatio­n; e­fficient utilization of conserved sequence motifs to mediate binding interactions; the ability to bind partners with high specificity but modest affinity, leading to rapid and spontaneous dissociation and termination of the signal 1,3,19 ; kinetic advantages in signalling 20 , as their extremely fast association rates allow signals to be rapidly turned on.



TIGHT REGULATION:
Esta alta promiscuidad quizas sea la explicacion de por que este tipo de proteinas esta altamente regulado at the transcriptional, RNA and protein levels
Perhaps offering a further rationale for such tight
regulation, structural disorder is also heavily involved
in the formation of insoluble and intractable aggregates,
known as amyloids (esto creo que esta refutado en la parte de amyloids)

The
most likely explanation is that proteolytic degra-
dation is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells, being
carried out by the proteasomes in response to ubi-
quitination or other such signals
Clearly, unfolded proteins can be functional
under such circumstances, although one may sus-
pect that the lifetime of such molecules might well
be shorter than for other cellular components that
are well-folded at all times. This reduced lifetime
may also constitute a component of the regulation
of these proteins, a possibility made more plausible
by the vital roles many of them play in cell cycle
regulation and in transcriptional and translational
processes. Conceivably, the sensitivity and short
response time implicit in many of these processes
could be mediated by a system where the regulat-
ory molecules are targeted for rapid turnover.

Certain biological functions, such as enzyme cat-
alysis, immunological recognition, or molecular
discrimination by receptors, absolutely demand
exquisite control of three-dimensional structure. In
contrast, functions such as signaling can be
achieved by linear sequences, simple sequence pat-
terns, or by isolated secondary structural motifs.

Las funciones desarrolladas por las IDPs son generalmente aquellas que mas se benefician de la falta de una estructura estable. As a result, IDPs are generally thought to be
involved in processes of signaling and regulation. Most of the functions that correlate with the presence of long disordered regions are related to regulation via transcription and translation, whereas functions that correlate with the lack of disorder are dominated by enzymatic catalysis.

the transcriptional rates of
mRNAs encoding IDPs and ordered proteins were comparable. However the IDP-encoding
transcripts were generally less abundant than transcripts encoding ordered proteins due to
the increased decay rates of the formers.

The existence of tight regulation of the IDP abundance was also established at the protein
level. In fact, IDPs were shown to be less abundant than ordered proteins due to the lower
rate of protein synthesis and shorter protein half-lives.
IDPs were shown to be substrates of twice as
many kinases as were ordered proteins. Furthermore, the vast majority of kinases whose
substrates were IDPs were either regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner, or activated
upon exposure to particular stimuli or stress (Gsponer et al., 2008). Therefore, post-
translational modifications may not only serve as important mechanism for the fine-tuning
of the IDP functions but possibly they are necessary to tune the IDP availability under the
different cellular conditions.





RELACION CON EL SPLICING ALTERNATIVO: 
In several recent works it has been shown that the functional and evolution-
ary agility of IDPs can be ascribed to the inclusion or
exclusion of such motifs in RNA maturation; that is, by
alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and RNA
editing, the alternative isoforms thus generated promote
the functional diversification of the proteome  (ref. Linear motifs: lost in (pre)translation). This
mechanism can result in a change in diverse functional
attributes, such as subcellular localization, protein–pro-
tein interaction, phase transitions and even opposing
(dominant negative) function, as also demonstrated by
studying tissue-specific forms of alternative splicing. These
protein isoforms tend to occupy central positions in inter-
action networks and their pattern of interaction partners
tend to significantly differ [63]; that is, structural disorder
and encoded motifs have a strong potential to define and
redefine wiring of cellular signaling pathways.







'COSTO BIOLOGICO' DE LAS IDPs (y relacion con las enfermedades):

One observation pertains to chromosomal translocations,
which fuse segments of distinct genes and generate
oncogenic protein chimeras in cancer. In a comprehen-
sive bioinformatic analysis of 406 translocation-related
human proteins, such as BCR-ABL and CBP-MLL [47],
these proteins, and their translocation breakpoints in
particular, were shown to be significantly enriched in
disorder. Apparently, structural disorder enables these
chimeras to evade cellular surveillance mechanisms and
exert their deleterious functions.

Translocations in disordered regions leave the
folded domains intact and thereby lead to a fusion pro-
tein with aberrant functions. By contrast, truncations
or translocations in the regions of a gene that encode
fully structured domains would almost certainly lead
to the production of a misfolded protein, which would
be rapidly degraded by the cellular machinery and
would therefore not produce a disease phenotype.

Disordered regions can also have a biological cost in
terms of the promotion and proliferation of protein-
folding diseases.



Another recent paper addressed the related phenomenon of dosage sensitivity,
 that is asked what renders gene products harmful when they are overexpressed. It was found that predicted
intrinsic protein disorder is the strongest determinant of this effect, suggesting that the likely cause of
dosage sensitivity is binding promiscuity of IDPs.


A corollary of the foregoing observations is that structural
disorder seems to enable the rapid appearance of novel,
‘less-evolved’ proteins that have not undergone a long
evolutionary selection.

LINEAR MOTIFS:



INTRODUCCION, ORIGEN EVOLUTIVO, FUNCION, ETC:



Linear motifs are short: between three and ten amino acids,
of which usually just two or three are important for function.
This makes them fundamentally different from domains in
terms of how they arise or how long they tend to be conserved
over evolutionary lineages.
Domains face tough requirements
of being able to fold into a stable, globular structure and enact
a specific function. When duplicated they face the additional
challenge of evolving a new function before being lost [2]. Lin-
ear motifs, in contrast, are very likely to arise or disappear by
chance: just one mutation can change an inert stretch of se-
quence into a functional linear motif, or cause a functional site
to become inactive. This gives them a certain evolutionary
plasticity missing from protein domains.
For critical interactions, this plasticity is risky, since a sin-
gle mutation can remove a critical interaction.
The overall consequence of the above is a poor general con-
servation of instances of linear motifs.

In the sense that they are modular, or repeated in many dif-
ferent contexts, linear motifs are similar to domains. However,
they differ in one critical aspect: whereas domains are now ac-
cepted only to arise by gene duplication, linear motifs, because
of their short length, can easily arise convergently.The fact
that they are defined by only a handful (usually 2–4) fixed ami-
no acids makes them very likely to arise or disappear by muta-
tions.


The short length and the fact that they are rarely conserved
over long evolutionary distances makes linear motifs difficult
to find computationally, or to detect in the laboratory.


what do they mean for Nature?
The low-affinity probably means that Nature herself is just a little bit fuzzy on what
she considers to be a functional instance of a motif. As men-
tioned above, localization and regulation of expression could
reduce the number of accessible functional sites, but the ques-
tion nevertheless arises as to why such a system exists in Nature
at all? The best explanation is probably plasticity: such a fuzzy
network of interactions lends itself well to fast adaptation. Lin-
ear motifs can be switched on or off relatively easily by point
mutations, and their redundancy and weak affinity probably
means that the loss or gain of one will only rarely have drastic
consequences on the evolving system.

RESULTADOS - CONCLUSIONES - DISCUSION:


Basandose en el patron estructural encontrado (the LM with its flanking region is a locally unstructured segment of the protein, onto which a couple of conserved, mostly hydrophobic, specificity-determinant residues are grafted.) se propone que los LM, junto con las secuencias flanqueantes forman una unidad funcional 
structural pattern, we propose
that LMs together with their flanking segments form a larger
functional unit that can be considered as a super-secondary
structural element. Such elements classically correspond to structural/functional units within globular proteins, exemplified by the helix-turn-helix motif in DNA recognition 
or the alfa-beta-alfa fold in nucleotide coenzyme binding. These elements are defined by a conserved spatial arrangement of secondary structural elements, maintained by a characteristic amino acid composition. 
The super-secondary element encompassing LMs, as defined here, conforms to this definition, as it consists of a functional unit composed of three structurally defined parts: a
short, locally structured segment sandwiched between two disordered regions. The properties of the unstructured stretches are determined solely by their amino acid composition(ver estudios sobre la composicion en los parrafos anteriores), while the actual primary sequence is critical only for the central part. This is not only an evolutionary economical solution to modulate protein-protein interactions, but also provides various benefits in the recognition process itself.

The ensuing binding mode, where determinant residues serve as contact sites, while variable residues within the LM as well as in its flanking environment ensures their proper orientation, has
been often implicated in the interactions of IUPs with their partners, in the form of short recognition elements, described in various contexts as preformed structural elements, primary contact sites or molecular recognition elements (ACA YA HAY UN PARECIDO EN EL MECANISMO).
Besides a proper control on the thermodynamics of binding, this binding mode also enables an increased speed of recognition, also formulated in mechanistic models such as protein fishing or fly-casting. 
These considerations argue that the molecular action of LMs is intertwined(entrelazada) with the structural malleability of their embedding environment. Flanking segments enable the effective recognition of the target site that results in low-affinity contacts, which are of high specificity but readily reversible. Such modes of interactions are of significant benefit in regulation, signaling and network organization functions,

RELACION ENTRE AGREGACION Y  IUPs:
Since many completely or partially disordered proteins, especially hubs, play key roles in
regulation and coordination of almost all the biochemical processes inside the cell, their
misfolding can be pathogenic. This fact provides a new view on the molecular mechanisms
of the diseases associated with amyloid fibril formation. In contrast to the globular proteins,
which have to unfold prior to aggregation (Jahn and Radford, 2005), IDPs are always ready
for intermolecular interactions. An unbound fragment of an IDP possesses a strong ability to
interact, and therefore can bind either to natural partners forming native complexes or to
similar molecules forming various aggregates. This raises the question of why IDPs do not
always form aggregates in the norm. One of the potential answers is the fact that inside the
cell, the IDPs typically form complexes with natural partners.
Furthermore, nature developed very sophisticated protection mechanisms (chaperones,
proteasome, etc.) for the effective prevention of dangerous consequences of misfolding. In
other words, in the cell, any given protein is not acting in the isolation, is never alone and is
constantly "watched" by the protective machinery. This machinery is rather robust and can
tolerate significant loads. Obviously, factors that affect these protective mechanisms will
contribute to the probability of disease development (see below). Finally, based on the
analysis of the IDP amino acid composition, it would be clearly a mistake to assume that an
averaged IDP possesses higher propensity towards aggregation than an averaged ordered
protein. In fact, many IDPs contain large number of charged and polar residues. In addition
to the hydrophobic interactions, the net charge is one of the major factors determining
aggregation behavior of a protein.
Many proteins tend to aggregate when the net charge is
zero (at their respective pIs); i.e., under the conditions where the repulsion between the
various protein molecules is minimized (Chiti, 2006). However, since IDPs are often
characterized by extreme pIs (which can be as low as pH 3.0 and as high as pH 12.0) it
would be very difficult for them to reach the conditions of zero net charge physiologically.
This means that evolution worked against misfolding and aggregation, and the sequences of
IDPs were selected so that they do not misfold and aggregate easily.
