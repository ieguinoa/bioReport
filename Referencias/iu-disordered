INDUCED FIT:



2 modelos describen el coupled binding and folding

The conformational selection mechanism is based on the hypothesis that when free in solution, IDP populates the
ensemble of conformations and, from this ensemble, the binding partner “chooses” or
“selects” a specific conformation which closely approximates that of the bound form. An
illustrative example of the conformational selection mechanism in the recognition process is
so-called “preformed structural elements” or elements of local residual structure, which are
frequently observed in IDPs and which are crucial for the IDP interactions with its specific
partners

Induced folding model postulates that IDP associates with
its binding partner in a fully disordered state and subsequently folds in association with the
target protein. In molecular recognition, this model is exemplified by so-called molecular
recognition elements or features, which are short (around 20 residues) structural elements
which are found within the regions of disorder and which mediates certain classes of binding
events of disordered regions undergoing a disorder-to-order transition into a specific
structure that is stabilized by binding to its partner. These recognition motifs can fold
into α-helix, β-strand, or form irregular structure on binding to a target protein


Obviously, in reality, either one of the outlined above
mechanisms, the conformational selection model or the induced folding model, or some
combination of the two can be used


**********ESTO ES MASOMENOS LO MISMO PERO DICHO DE OTRA FORMA
An important feature of the intrinsically unstructured proteins is that they are able to undergo a disorder-to-or-der transition (i. e. partial or complete folding) during or prior to their biological function. In other words, intrinsically unfolded proteins in vivo are likely to be stabilized by functional binding to specific targets and ligands (such as a variety of small molecules, substrates, cofactors, other proteins, nucleic acids, membranes and so on). The functional importance of being disordered has been intensively analyzed, and it has been established that increased intrinsic plasticity represents an important prerequisite for effective molecular recognition

FUNCIONES Y MECANISMOS FUNCIONALES:



MECANISMOS FUNCIONALES:





A large interface with a
particular structure and pattern of residues is required for
protein function; as to the rest, function is not affected.
Even if the protein is natively disordered in the ensemble,
the relative population of the native conformation is still
large. Conformational shift and re-distribution will attend
to the function.










Non-globular sequence segments often contain short linear peptide motifs (e.g. SH3-binding sites) which are important for protein function.
***********ACA HAY UN POSIBLE ENGANCHE CON EL TEMA DE ELM *********
It was
previously known that many types of protein–protein
interactions and enzymatic modifications are mediated
by short sequence elements (consensus sites), which gave
way to the much broader concept of short linear motifs
(SLiMs) or eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs). It was formally shown
that most motifs are found in intrinsically disordered
regions (IDRs)

On a more structural basis, the related
concepts of preformed structural elements (PSEs [41]) and
molecular recognition features (MoRFs [42]) are suggested
to be short disordered regions that sample structured
states within the conformational ensemble, and become
fully ordered upon binding to the partner.
Binding by
motifs is usually weak, transient, and possibly of limited
specificity [39], which can be made stronger and/or more
specific by either cooperating with flanking regions, com-
bining several motifs, or utilizing longer disordered
domains (VER ref:Close encounters of the third kind: disordered
domains and the interactions of proteins,
 en este paper se habla de 'disordered domains' como un tipo distinto a los short recognition motifs)
************DICHO DE OTRA FORMA
Binding of IDPs to their partners via linear motifs is often
weak and is of limited specificity [11]. When stronger,
more specific binding is required, IDPs use two distinct
strategies. For one, they may use disordered domains for
recognition [23], which are longer than 20 residues and
conform to all three domain definitions, that is they are
autonomous structural, functional, and evolutionary units.
These long disordered regions (Figure 2) should be
recognized as novel structural–functional elements of
IDPs [23]. The other strategy is the combined action
of several motifs,








IDPs EN FUNCIONES DE INTERACCION
When IUPs/IDRs are involved in PPIs,
they undergo induced folding or disorder-to-order
transition, 18,19 suggested to provide several advan-
tages, such as specificity without excessive binding
strength, increased speed of interaction, binding
promiscuity or moonlighting, among others. 14,20,21
These advantages underscore the high frequency of
disorder in proteins organizing the interactome, i.e.
in hubs. 22–25 In terms of the molecular details of the
recognition process, it has been suggested that IUPs
often use short sequential recognition elements for
binding, termed primary contact sites, 26 preformed
structural elements, 27 or molecular recognition
elements/features (MorEs/MorFs). 28,29 In direct
connection with these concepts, a recent analysis
has shown that short linear motifs in proteins often
fall into locally disordered regions, 30 underlying
the suggestion that interactions of IUPs/IDRs 
We found that the chemical and physical
features of interfaces of IUPs are distinct from those
of globular proteins in many aspects, such as a much
larger relative area, and preference for hydrophobic
residues, which exceeds even the interior of the
protein. Their much larger contact number per
residue are indicative of structural adaptation
driven by induced folding, and suggest that IUPs
might preferentially gain stabilization energy from
contacts with the partner.
The detailed analysis of the amino acid composi-
tion of the interfaces provides full evidence for this
point, i.e. that IUPs preserve and expose their
hydrophobic residues for partner binding. In agree-
ment with previous studies, 5,32 the analysis of
ordered proteins shows that their surface is enriched
in polar/charged residues, and depleted in hydro-
phobic residues
The characteristic differences found between the two types of complexes
suggest that IUPs represent a distinct molecular implementation of the
principles of protein–protein recognition. The interfaces do not differ in size,
but those of IUPs cover a much larger part of the surface of the protein than
for their ordered counterparts. Moreover, IUP interfaces are significantly
more hydrophobic relative to their overall amino acid composition, but also
in absolute terms. They rely more on hydrophobic–hydrophobic than on
polar–polar interactions. Their amino acids in the interface realize more
intermolecular contacts, which suggests a better fit with the partner due to
induced folding upon binding that results in a better adaptation to the
partner. The two modes of interaction also differ in that IUPs usually use
only a single continuous segment for partner binding, whereas the binding
sites of ordered proteins are more segmented. Probably, all these features
contribute to the increased evolutionary conservation of IUP interface
residues. These noted molecular differences are also manifested in the
interaction energies of IUPs.




FUNCIONALIDADES:

El estudio de estas proteinas llevo a encontrar una gran cantidad de funcionalidades asociadas.The physical characteristics of IDPs allow an exquisite level of control of cellular signalling processes. Their favourable characteristics include: the presence of small recognition elements that fold on partner binding; a degree of flexibility, which enables them to interact promiscuously with different targets on different occasions; accessible sites for post-translational modificatio­n; e­fficient utilization of conserved sequence motifs to mediate binding interactions; the ability to bind partners with high specificity but modest affinity, leading to rapid and spontaneous dissociation and termination of the signal 1,3,19 ; kinetic advantages in signalling 20 , as their extremely fast association rates allow signals to be rapidly turned on.



TIGHT REGULATION:
Esta alta promiscuidad quizas sea la explicacion de por que este tipo de proteinas esta altamente regulado at the transcriptional, RNA and protein levels
Perhaps offering a further rationale for such tight
regulation, structural disorder is also heavily involved
in the formation of insoluble and intractable aggregates,
known as amyloids (esto creo que esta refutado en la parte de amyloids)

The
most likely explanation is that proteolytic degra-
dation is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells, being
carried out by the proteasomes in response to ubi-
quitination or other such signals
Clearly, unfolded proteins can be functional
under such circumstances, although one may sus-
pect that the lifetime of such molecules might well
be shorter than for other cellular components that
are well-folded at all times. This reduced lifetime
may also constitute a component of the regulation
of these proteins, a possibility made more plausible
by the vital roles many of them play in cell cycle
regulation and in transcriptional and translational
processes. Conceivably, the sensitivity and short
response time implicit in many of these processes
could be mediated by a system where the regulat-
ory molecules are targeted for rapid turnover.

Certain biological functions, such as enzyme cat-
alysis, immunological recognition, or molecular
discrimination by receptors, absolutely demand
exquisite control of three-dimensional structure. In
contrast, functions such as signaling can be
achieved by linear sequences, simple sequence pat-
terns, or by isolated secondary structural motifs.

Las funciones desarrolladas por las IDPs son generalmente aquellas que mas se benefician de la falta de una estructura estable. As a result, IDPs are generally thought to be
involved in processes of signaling and regulation. Most of the functions that correlate with the presence of long disordered regions are related to regulation via transcription and translation, whereas functions that correlate with the lack of disorder are dominated by enzymatic catalysis.

the transcriptional rates of
mRNAs encoding IDPs and ordered proteins were comparable. However the IDP-encoding
transcripts were generally less abundant than transcripts encoding ordered proteins due to
the increased decay rates of the formers.

The existence of tight regulation of the IDP abundance was also established at the protein
level. In fact, IDPs were shown to be less abundant than ordered proteins due to the lower
rate of protein synthesis and shorter protein half-lives.
IDPs were shown to be substrates of twice as
many kinases as were ordered proteins. Furthermore, the vast majority of kinases whose
substrates were IDPs were either regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner, or activated
upon exposure to particular stimuli or stress (Gsponer et al., 2008). Therefore, post-
translational modifications may not only serve as important mechanism for the fine-tuning
of the IDP functions but possibly they are necessary to tune the IDP availability under the
different cellular conditions.





RELACION CON EL SPLICING ALTERNATIVO: 
In several recent works it has been shown that the functional and evolution-
ary agility of IDPs can be ascribed to the inclusion or
exclusion of such motifs in RNA maturation; that is, by
alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and RNA
editing, the alternative isoforms thus generated promote
the functional diversification of the proteome  (ref. Linear motifs: lost in (pre)translation). This
mechanism can result in a change in diverse functional
attributes, such as subcellular localization, protein–pro-
tein interaction, phase transitions and even opposing
(dominant negative) function, as also demonstrated by
studying tissue-specific forms of alternative splicing. These
protein isoforms tend to occupy central positions in inter-
action networks and their pattern of interaction partners
tend to significantly differ [63]; that is, structural disorder
and encoded motifs have a strong potential to define and
redefine wiring of cellular signaling pathways.







'COSTO BIOLOGICO' DE LAS IDPs (y relacion con las enfermedades):

One observation pertains to chromosomal translocations,
which fuse segments of distinct genes and generate
oncogenic protein chimeras in cancer. In a comprehen-
sive bioinformatic analysis of 406 translocation-related
human proteins, such as BCR-ABL and CBP-MLL [47],
these proteins, and their translocation breakpoints in
particular, were shown to be significantly enriched in
disorder. Apparently, structural disorder enables these
chimeras to evade cellular surveillance mechanisms and
exert their deleterious functions.

Translocations in disordered regions leave the
folded domains intact and thereby lead to a fusion pro-
tein with aberrant functions. By contrast, truncations
or translocations in the regions of a gene that encode
fully structured domains would almost certainly lead
to the production of a misfolded protein, which would
be rapidly degraded by the cellular machinery and
would therefore not produce a disease phenotype.

Disordered regions can also have a biological cost in
terms of the promotion and proliferation of protein-
folding diseases.



Another recent paper addressed the related phenomenon of dosage sensitivity,
 that is asked what renders gene products harmful when they are overexpressed. It was found that predicted
intrinsic protein disorder is the strongest determinant of this effect, suggesting that the likely cause of
dosage sensitivity is binding promiscuity of IDPs.


A corollary of the foregoing observations is that structural
disorder seems to enable the rapid appearance of novel,
‘less-evolved’ proteins that have not undergone a long
evolutionary selection.

METODOS EXPERIMENTALES QUE SE USARON INICIALMENTE PARA IDENTIFICAR PROTEINAS/REGIONES DESORDENADAS:

The key experimental method for obtaining systematic
site-specific information on unstructured proteins is
NMR spectroscopy.
Other techniques, including CIRCULAR DICHROISM (CD),
hydrodynamic measurements, FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY ,
VIBRATIONAL CD SPECTROSCOPY and RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY , as well
as traditional biochemical studies of proteolytic suscep-
tibility, can give important information

	-X-ray crystallography: Disorder leads to missing electron density in protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Two
types of disorder have been recognized, static and dynamic. 30,72

	-NMR spectroscopy: 3D structures can be determined for proteins in
solution by NMR. The absence of the requirement for crystallization means that
NMR provides a less biased estimate of the commonness of disorder as compared
to crystallography. 
For several examples, comparison of the results of the X-ray and NMR analyses of the same
protein has revealed that solution and crystal structures can be quite different, with solution
structures being much more flexible [24,25]. Evidently the interactions in the crystal lattice
reduce protein flexibility and, in some cases, have even been observed to induce disorder to
order transitions in functionally important protein regions. Thus, NMR spectroscopy is able to
directly confirm the flexibility of protein segments that are missing in crystallographic
experiments and can sometimes indicate flexible regions that have become rigid due to crystal
contacts.
One way to characterize the dynamic struc-
ture of IUPs is by measuring their backbone flexibility
using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation
experiments
NMR relaxation measurements can be
used to assess the residue specific molecular motions of
IUPs on timescales ranging from picoseconds to millisec-
onds, covering the range of most biologically relevant
protein motions. A particularly powerful and rapid way to
assess backbone flexibility is by analyzing the NMR
relaxation data using reduced spectral density mapping
(Farrow et al. 1997; Lefevre et al. 1996). This approach
provides an estimate of backbone flexibility for each amino
acid residue and it can be used to determine whether the
backbone flexibility in a family of IUPs is conserved.
	-Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy: Structural information for proteins
in solution is also provided by circular dichroism. 81 Far UV CD spectra provide
estimates of secondary structure and so distinguish ordered and molten globular
forms from random coil.
	
	-Protease digestion: Since a structured region has to become unfolded over more than 10
residues to be cut by typical proteases, 87 the ratio of the digestion rates,
(disordered) / (ordered), should be about equal to e -∆G/RT , where ∆G is the free
energy of unfolding the segment. Protease digestion is especially useful when used in combination with
other methods.
For example, protease digestion can be used with X-ray
diffraction to help sort out whether a region of missing electron density is due to a
wobbly domain or to intrinsic disorder.

	-Stoke’s radius determination: Random-coil disorder has also been
detected by various methods for obtaining Stoke’s radius such as small angle X-
ray scattering or size exclusion chromatography. 93 Abnormally large radii for a
given molecular weight provide evidence of disorder.

METODOS COMPUTACIONALES PARA PREDECIR DESORDEN:


REFERENCIAS: 
	PONDR-FIT: a meta-predictor of intrinsically disordered amino acids 





A signature
of probable intrinsic disorder is the presence of low
sequence complexity and amino-acid compositional
bias, with a low content of bulky hydrophobic aminoacids (Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr), which would
normally form the core of a folded globular protein, and
a high proportion of particular polar and charged amino


PONDR: In 1997, the first Predictor Of Natural Disordered Regions (PONDR) was developed.
acids (Gln, Ser, Pro, Glu, Lys and, on occasion, Gly and
Ala) .



Disprot: Intriguingly, thousands of the structures in PDB are now known to contain disordered chains that become structured only in the presence of the partner, and there are also many regions that are actually missing from electron density maps [11]. Such evidence added to that obtained by other techniques [mostly NMR and circular dichroism (CD)], which enabled the creation of DisProt, a database dedicated to structural disorder (Ref: DisProt: the Database of Disordered Proteins. Nucleic Acids Res).








En orden historico:


1) Primeros predictores: The first period (1) First informal IDP predictor The
first period is the beginning of the prediction for IDPs
and includes the predictors designed before 2002. In
1979, much earlier than the publication of the PONDR ® s,
Williams [34] made the first attempt to predict lack of
structure based on amino acid sequence. He suggested
that the ratio given by (number of charged amino acids)/
(number of hydrophobic amino acids) would distinguish
non-folding proteins from structured examples. This
suggestion was based on very good results for a small
number of examples.


2) Development of the PONDR ® family: The first formal predictor was published by Romero et al. [36]
in 1997, which could predict disordered structure in
proteins based on the specific biases of their amino acid
sequences.These predictors were subsequently called
Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions (PONDR ® )
followed by letters that describe the proteins in the train-
ing set for that particular predictor.
Basically, the PONDR ® algorithms work because the
amino acid compositions in a window of N amino ac-
ids for structured proteins are distinguishable from the
compositions for disordered proteins. A typical PONDR ®
uses the following types of inputs: (1) amino acid com-
positions; (2) attributes derived from compositions such
as sequence complexity; and (3) attributes derived from
compositions via some function or scale such as hydrop-
athy, net charge, etc. These various types of attributes
are then weighted and combined in a non-linear manner,
typically via artificial neural networks (ANNs). Other
methods of combining the attributes such as support vec-
tor machines (SVMs) and logistic regression give results
very similar to those obtained with ANNs.




3) CH-plot In 2000 Uversky et al. used charge and
hydropathy to predict disorder, but in an entirely new
way compared to approach used by Williams much
earlier as described above. The Uversky et al. [35] ap-
proach is based on the simple reasoning that the folding
of a protein is governed by a balance between attractive
forces (e.g., hydrophobic interactions) and repulsive
forces (Coulomb or electrostatic repulsion). Rather than
the total charge used in the Williams ratio, net charge
is more appropriate for estimating repulsion. High net
charge leads to strong electrostatic repulsion and low
hydropathy minimally means less driving force for com-
paction. Thus, whether a query sequence is disordered
or not can be predicted based on the ratio of its mean net
charge with mean hydropathy. The mean hydropathy is
defined as the sum of the hydropathies of all residues di-
vided by the number of residues in the polypeptide. The
mean net charge is similarly defined as the net charge, at
pH 7.0, divided by the total number of residues. A plot of
mean net charge versus mean hydropathy (the CH-plot)
separates structured and disordered proteins into distinct
regions and thereby provides a binary predictor


4) GlobPlot: The kernel idea of GlobPlot is the relative propensity
of an amino acid residue to be in an ordered or disor-
dered state [43]. GlobPlot uses an amino acid scale based
on the difference in the probability for a given amino
acid to be in random coil or to be in regular secondary
structure. The basic algorithm behind GlobPlot is simple
and very fast, representing a sum function.

5)DisEMBL designed by Linding et al. [43] consists
of three separate ANN predictors, to predict three kinds
of disordered structures in proteins, which represent
residues within “loops/coils (as defined by DSSP38)”,
“hot loops (loops with high B-factors)”, or those that are
missing from the PDB X-ray structures (called “Remark
465”


6)DISOPRED employs a feed-forward neural network
to predict disordered regions [45]. It needs to use a rela-
tively large number of hidden units to enhance the map-
ping ability, and this may cause over-fitting and slow the
training down. So, they designed DISOPRED2 based on
SVMs instead of ANN


7) IUPred: Dosztanyi et al. suggested that a large number of inter-
residue interactions is responsible for structure stabiliza-
tion of proteins [50, 51]. In contrast, IDPs don’t have
sufficient numbers of stabilizing inter-residue interac-
tions. Based on this reasoning, an IUPred algorithm esti-
mating the inter-residue interactions was designed. First,
the interaction energy between each pair of amino acids
based on their C β positions was estimated. This was done
	by calculating the potential mutual contact energies for
all amino acid pairs in a dataset of globular proteins with
known structure. This is a fairly standard approach in
computational biology, and in this work Dosztanyi et al.
compared several such mutual contact energies estimated
previously by other researchers, with the set developed
by Thomas and Dill, found to be the best in this particu-
lar application [92]. The various pairwise energies were
assembled into a 20 × 20 energy matrix, which was used
in the next step, the estimation of the mutual interaction
energies for any given protein. The prediction utilizes
this energy prediction matrix and the amino acid compo-
sitions put into a quadratic expression. These statistical
values represent the ability to form stabilization contacts
between amino acids in polypeptide chains. The poten-
tial mutual interactions were estimated using amino acid
compositions, not three-dimensional structures. These
composition-based energies were compared with three-
dimensional structure-based energies of the proteins for
which the actual side chain interactions are known. The
composition-based potential mutual interaction energies
and the structure-based energies were found to be highly
correlated, thus the former can be used to estimate the
latter even when the structures are not known. To use
this approach to predict structure or disorder, compo-
sition-based calculations for a set of proteins that fold
into three-dimensional structures were compared with
composition-based calculations for a set of disordered
proteins. The estimated potential interaction energies for
the structured proteins were much greater than the same
energies for the unstructured proteins, and from these
results the energy boundary between ordered and disor-
dered proteins as a function of length was determined.
This boundary allows the recognition of intrinsic disor-
der. In brief, if a sequence contains too few hydrophobic
residues, then the composition-based potential mutual in-
teraction energy will necessarily be too small and thereby
indicate the lack of potential for folding
